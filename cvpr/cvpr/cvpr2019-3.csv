0,Holistic and Comprehensive Annotation of Clinically Significant Findings on Diverse CT Images: Learning From Radiology Reports and Label Ontology,"In radiologists' routine work, one major task is to read a medical image, e.g., a CT scan, find significant lesions, and describe them in the radiology report. In this paper, we study the lesion description or annotation problem. Given a lesion image, our aim is to predict a comprehensive set of relevant labels, such as the lesion's body part, type, and attributes, which may assist downstream fine-grained diagnosis. To address this task, we first design a deep learning module to extract relevant semantic labels from the radiology reports associated with the lesion images. With the images and text-mined labels, we propose a lesion annotation network (LesaNet) based on a multilabel convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn all labels holistically. Hierarchical relations and mutually exclusive relations between the labels are leveraged to improve the label prediction accuracy. The relations are utilized in a label expansion strategy and a reliable hard example mining algorithm. We also attach a simple score propagation layer on LesaNet to enhance recall and explore implicit relation between labels. Multilabel metric learning is combined with classification to enable interpretable prediction. We evaluated LesaNet on the public DeepLesion dataset, which contains over 32K diverse lesion images. Experiments show that LesaNet can precisely annotate the lesions using an ontology of 171 fine-grained labels with an average AUC of 0.9344.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Holistic,and,Comprehensive,Annotation,of,Clinically,Significant,Findings,on,Diverse,CT,Images:,Learning,From,Radiology,Reports,and,Label,Ontology"
1,Robust Histopathology Image Analysis: To Label or to Synthesize?,"Detection, segmentation and classification of nuclei are fundamental analysis operations in digital pathology. Existing state-of-the-art approaches demand extensive amount of supervised training data from pathologists and may still perform poorly in images from unseen tissue types. We propose an unsupervised approach for histopathology image segmentation that synthesizes heterogeneous sets of training image patches, of every tissue type. Although our synthetic patches are not always of high quality, we harness the motley crew of generated samples through a generally applicable importance sampling method. This proposed approach, for the first time, re-weighs the training loss over synthetic data so that the ideal (unbiased) generalization loss over the true data distribution is minimized. This enables us to use a random polygon generator to synthesize approximate cellular structures (i.e., nuclear masks) for which no real examples are given in many tissue types, and hence, GAN-based methods are not suited. In addition, we propose a hybrid synthesis pipeline that utilizes textures in real histopathology patches and GAN models, to tackle heterogeneity in tissue textures. Compared with existing state-of-the-art supervised models, our approach generalizes significantly better on cancer types without training data. Even in cancer types with training data, our approach achieves the same performance without supervision cost. We release code and segmentation results on over 5000 Whole Slide Images (WSI) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository, a dataset that would be orders of magnitude larger than what is available today.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Robust,Histopathology,Image,Analysis:,To,Label,or,to,Synthesize?"
2,Data Augmentation Using Learned Transformations for One-Shot Medical Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation is an important task in many medical applications. Methods based on convolutional neural networks attain state-of-the-art accuracy; however, they typically rely on supervised training with large labeled datasets. Labeling medical images requires significant expertise and time, and typical hand-tuned approaches for data augmentation fail to capture the complex variations in such images.   We present an automated data augmentation method for synthesizing labeled medical images. We demonstrate our method on the task of segmenting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. Our method requires only a single segmented scan, and leverages other unlabeled scans in a semi-supervised approach. We learn a model of transformations from the images, and use the model along with the labeled example to synthesize additional labeled examples. Each transformation is comprised of a spatial deformation field and an intensity change, enabling the synthesis of complex effects such as variations in anatomy and image acquisition procedures. We show that training a supervised segmenter with these new examples provides significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for one-shot biomedical image segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Data,Augmentation,Using,Learned,Transformations,for,One-Shot,Medical,Image,Segmentation"
3,Shifting More Attention to Video Salient Object Detection,"The last decade has witnessed a growing interest in video salient object detection (VSOD). However, the research community long-term lacked a well-established VSOD dataset representative of real dynamic scenes with high-quality annotations. To address this issue, we elaborately collected a visual-attention-consistent Densely Annotated VSOD (DAVSOD) dataset, which contains 226 videos with 23,938 frames that cover diverse realistic-scenes, objects, instances and motions. With corresponding real human eye-fixation data, we obtain precise ground-truths. This is the first work that explicitly emphasizes the challenge of saliency shift, i.e., the video salient object(s) may dynamically change. To further contribute the community a complete benchmark, we systematically assess 17 representative VSOD algorithms over seven existing VSOD datasets and our DAVSOD with totally  84K frames (largest-scale). Utilizing three famous metrics, we then present a comprehensive and insightful performance analysis. Furthermore, we propose a baseline model. It is equipped with a saliency shift- aware convLSTM, which can efficiently capture video saliency dynamics through learning human attention-shift behavior. Extensive experiments open up promising future directions for model development and comparison.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Shifting,More,Attention,to,Video,Salient,Object,Detection"
4,Neural Task Graphs: Generalizing to Unseen Tasks From a Single Video Demonstration,"Our goal is to generate a policy to complete an unseen task given just a single video demonstration of the task in a given domain. We hypothesize that to successfully generalize to unseen complex tasks from a single video demonstration, it is necessary to explicitly incorporate the compositional structure of the tasks into the model. To this end, we propose Neural Task Graph (NTG) Networks, which use conjugate task graph as the intermediate representation to modularize both the video demonstration and the derived policy. We empirically show NTG achieves inter-task generalization on two complex tasks: Block Stacking in BulletPhysics and Object Collection in AI2-THOR. NTG improves data efficiency with visual input as well as achieve strong generalization without the need for dense hierarchical supervision. We further show that similar performance trends hold when applied to real-world data. We show that NTG can effectively predict task structure on the JIGSAWS surgical dataset and generalize to unseen tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Neural,Task,Graphs:,Generalizing,to,Unseen,Tasks,From,a,Single,Video,Demonstration"
5,Beyond Tracking: Selecting Memory and Refining Poses for Deep Visual Odometry,"Most previous learning-based visual odometry (VO) methods take VO as a pure tracking problem. In contrast, we present a VO framework by incorporating two additional components called Memory and Refining. The Memory component preserves global information by employing an adaptive and efficient selection strategy. The Refining component ameliorates previous results with the contexts stored in the Memory by adopting a spatial-temporal attention mechanism for feature distilling. Experiments on the KITTI and TUM-RGBD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based methods by a large margin and produces competitive results against classic monocular VO approaches. Especially, our model achieves outstanding performance in challenging scenarios such as texture-less regions and abrupt motions, where classic VO algorithms tend to fail.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Beyond,Tracking:,Selecting,Memory,and,Refining,Poses,for,Deep,Visual,Odometry"
6,Image Generation From Layout,"Despite significant recent progress on generative models, controlled generation of images depicting multiple and complex object layouts is still a difficult problem. Among the core challenges are the diversity of appearance a given object may possess and, as a result, exponential set of images consistent with a specified layout. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for layout-based image generation; we call it Layout2Im. Given the coarse spatial layout (bounding boxes + object categories), our model can generate a set of realistic images which have the correct objects in the desired locations. The representation of each object is disentangled into a specified/certain part (category) and an unspecified/uncertain part (appearance). The category is encoded using a word embedding and the appearance is distilled into a low-dimensional vector sampled from a normal distribution. Individual object representations are composed together using convolutional LSTM, to obtain an encoding of the complete layout, and then decoded to an image. Several loss terms are introduced to encourage accurate and diverse generation. The proposed Layout2Im model significantly outperforms the previous state of the art, boosting the best reported inception score by 24.66% and 28.57% on the very challenging COCO-Stuff and Visual Genome datasets, respectively. Extensive experiments also demonstrate our method's ability to generate complex and diverse images with multiple objects.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Image,Generation,From,Layout"
7,Multimodal Explanations by Predicting Counterfactuality in Videos,"This study addresses generating counterfactual explanations with multimodal information. Our goal is not only to classify a video into a specific category, but also to provide explanations on why it is not categorized to a specific class with combinations of visual-linguistic information. Requirements that the expected output should satisfy are referred to as counterfactuality in this paper: (1) Compatibility of visual-linguistic explanations, and (2) Positiveness/negativeness for the specific positive/negative class. Exploiting a spatio-temporal region (tube) and an attribute as visual and linguistic explanations respectively, the explanation model is trained to predict the counterfactuality for possible combinations of multimodal information in a post-hoc manner. The optimization problem, which appears during training/inference, can be efficiently solved by inserting a novel neural network layer, namely the maximum subpath layer. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by comparison with a baseline of the action recognition datasets extended for this task. Moreover, we provide information-theoretical insight into the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multimodal,Explanations,by,Predicting,Counterfactuality,in,Videos"
8,Learning to Explain With Complemental Examples,"This paper addresses the generation of explanations with visual examples. Given an input sample, we build a system that not only classifies it to a specific category, but also outputs linguistic explanations and a set of visual examples that render the decision interpretable. Focusing especially on the complementarity of the multimodal information, i.e., linguistic and visual examples, we attempt to achieve it by maximizing the interaction information, which provides a natural definition of complementarity from an information theoretical viewpoint. We propose a novel framework to generate complemental explanations, on which the joint distribution of the variables to explain, and those to be explained is parameterized by three different neural networks: predictor, linguistic explainer, and example selector. Explanation models are trained collaboratively to maximize the interaction information to ensure the generated explanation are complemental to each other for the target. The results of experiments conducted on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Explain,With,Complemental,Examples"
9,HAQ: Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization With Mixed Precision,"Model quantization is a widely used technique to compress and accelerate deep neural network (DNN) inference. Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and sub-optimal. There are plenty of specialized hardware for neural networks, but little research has been done for specialized neural network optimization for a particular hardware architecture. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"HAQ:,Hardware-Aware,Automated,Quantization,With,Mixed,Precision"
10,Content Authentication for Neural Imaging Pipelines: End-To-End Optimization of Photo Provenance in Complex Distribution Channels,"Forensic analysis of digital photo provenance relies on intrinsic traces left in the photograph at the time of its acquisition. Such analysis becomes unreliable after heavy post-processing, such as down-sampling and re-compression applied upon distribution in the Web. This paper explores end-to-end optimization of the entire image acquisition and distribution workflow to facilitate reliable forensic analysis at the end of the distribution channel. We demonstrate that neural imaging pipelines can be trained to replace the internals of digital cameras, and jointly optimized for high-fidelity photo development and reliable provenance analysis. In our experiments, the proposed approach increased image manipulation detection accuracy from 45% to over 90%. The findings encourage further research towards building more reliable imaging pipelines with explicit provenance-guaranteeing properties.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Content,Authentication,for,Neural,Imaging,Pipelines:,End-To-End,Optimization,of,Photo,Provenance,in,Complex,Distribution,Channels"
11,Inverse Procedural Modeling of Knitwear,"The analysis and modeling of cloth has received a lot of attention in recent years. While recent approaches are focused on woven cloth, we present a novel practical approach for the inference of more complex knitwear structures as well as the respective knitting instructions from only a single image without attached annotations. Knitwear is produced by repeating instances of the same pattern, consisting of grid-like arrangements of a small set of basic stitch types. Our framework addresses the identification and localization of the occurring stitch types, which is challenging due to huge appearance variations. The resulting coarsely localized stitch types are used to infer the underlying grid structure as well as for the extraction of the knitting instruction of pattern repeats, taking into account principles of Gestalt theory. Finally, the derived instructions allow the reproduction of the knitting structures, either as renderings or by actual knitting, as demonstrated in several examples.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Inverse,Procedural,Modeling,of,Knitwear"
12,Estimating 3D Motion and Forces of Person-Object Interactions From Monocular Video,"In this paper, we introduce a method to automatically reconstruct the 3D motion of a person interacting with an object from a single RGB video. Our method estimates the 3D poses of the person and the object, contact positions, and forces and torques actuated by the human limbs. The main contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we introduce an approach to jointly estimate the motion and the actuation forces of the person on the manipulated object by modeling contacts and the dynamics of their interactions. This is cast as a large-scale trajectory optimization problem. Second, we develop a method to automatically recognize from the input video the position and timing of contacts between the person and the object or the ground, thereby significantly simplifying the complexity of the optimization.  Third, we validate our approach on a recent MoCap dataset with ground truth contact forces and demonstrate its performance on a new dataset of Internet videos showing people manipulating a variety of tools in unconstrained environments.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Estimating,3D,Motion,and,Forces,of,Person-Object,Interactions,From,Monocular,Video"
13,DeepMapping: Unsupervised Map Estimation From Multiple Point Clouds,"We propose DeepMapping, a novel registration framework using deep neural networks (DNNs) as auxiliary functions to align multiple point clouds from scratch to a globally consistent frame. We use DNNs to model the highly non-convex mapping process that traditionally involves hand-crafted data association, sensor pose initialization, and global refinement. Our key novelty is that ""training"" these DNNs with properly defined unsupervised losses is equivalent to solving the underlying registration problem, but less sensitive to good initialization than ICP. Our framework contains two DNNs: a localization network that estimates the poses for input point clouds, and a map network that models the scene structure by estimating the occupancy status of global coordinates. This allows us to convert the registration problem to a binary occupancy classification, which can be solved efficiently using gradient-based optimization. We further show that DeepMapping can be readily extended to address the problem of Lidar SLAM by imposing geometric constraints between consecutive point clouds. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and real datasets. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that DeepMapping often enables more robust and accurate global registration of multiple point clouds than existing techniques.

Towards this goal, we design a holistic model that takes as input raw LIDAR data and a HD map and produces  interpretable intermediate representations in the form of 3D detections and their future trajectories, as well as a cost volume defining the goodness of each position that the self-driving car  can take within the planning horizon. We then sample a set of diverse physically possible trajectories and choose the one with the minimum learned cost. Importantly, our cost volume is able to naturally capture multi-modality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world driving data captured  in several cities in North America. Our experiments show that the learned cost volume can generate safer planning than all the baselines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"End-To-End,Interpretable,Neural,Motion,Planner"

The divergence triangle is a compact and symmetric (anti-symmetric) objective function that seamlessly integrates variational learning, adversarial learning, wake-sleep algorithm, and contrastive divergence in a unified probabilistic formulation. This unification makes the processes of sampling, inference, and energy evaluation readily available without the need for costly Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our experiments demonstrate that the divergence triangle is capable of learning (1) an energy-based model with well-formed energy landscape, (2) direct sampling in the form of a generator network, and (3) feed-forward inference that faithfully reconstructs observed as well as synthesized data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Divergence,Triangle,for,Joint,Training,of,Generator,Model,,Energy-Based,Model,,and,Inferential,Model"
16,Image Deformation Meta-Networks for One-Shot Learning,"Humans can robustly learn novel visual concepts even when images undergo various deformations and loose certain information. Mimicking the same behavior and synthesizing deformed instances of new concepts may help visual recognition systems perform better one-shot learning, i.e., learning concepts from one or few examples. Our key insight is that, while the deformed images may not be visually realistic, they still maintain critical semantic information and contribute significantly to formulating classifier decision boundaries. Inspired by the recent progress of meta-learning, we combine a meta-learner with an image deformation sub-network that produces additional training examples, and optimize both models in an end-to-end manner. The deformation sub-network learns to deform images by fusing a pair of images --- a probe image that keeps the visual content and a gallery image that diversifies the deformations. We demonstrate results on the widely used one-shot learning benchmarks (miniImageNet and ImageNet 1K Challenge datasets), which significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Image,Deformation,Meta-Networks,for,One-Shot,Learning"
17,Online High Rank Matrix Completion,"Recent advances in matrix completion enable data imputation in full-rank matrices by exploiting low dimensional (nonlinear) latent structure. In this paper, we develop a new model for high rank matrix completion (HRMC), together with batch and online methods to fit the model and out-of-sample extension to complete new data. The method works by (implicitly) mapping the data into a high dimensional polynomial feature space using the kernel trick; importantly, the data occupies a low dimensional subspace in this feature space, even when the original data matrix is of full-rank. The online method can handle streaming or sequential data and adapt to non-stationary latent structure, and enjoys much lower space and time complexity than previous methods for HRMC. For example, the time complexity is reduced from O(n^3) to O(r^3), where n is the number of data points, r is the matrix rank in the feature space, and r<< n. We also provide guidance on sampling rate required for these methods to succeed. Experimental results on synthetic data and motion data validate the performance of the proposed methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Online,High,Rank,Matrix,Completion"
18,Multispectral Imaging for Fine-Grained Recognition of Powders on Complex Backgrounds,"Hundreds of materials, such as drugs, explosives, makeup, food additives, are in the form of powder. Recognizing such powders is important for security checks, criminal identification, drug control, and quality assessment. However, powder recognition has drawn little attention in the computer vision community. Powders are hard to distinguish: they are amorphous, appear matte, have little color or texture variation and blend with surfaces they are deposited on in complex ways. To address these challenges, we present the first comprehensive dataset and approach for powder recognition using multi-spectral imaging. By using Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) multi-spectral imaging together with visible light (RGB) and Near Infrared (NIR), powders can be discriminated with reasonable accuracy. We present a method to select discriminative spectral bands to significantly reduce acquisition time while improving recognition accuracy. We propose a blending model to synthesize images of powders of various thickness deposited on a wide range of surfaces. Incorporating band selection and image synthesis, we conduct fine-grained recognition of 100 powders on complex backgrounds, and achieve 60% 70% accuracy on recognition with known powder location, and over 40% mean IoU without known location.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multispectral,Imaging,for,Fine-Grained,Recognition,of,Powders,on,Complex,Backgrounds"
19,ContactDB: Analyzing and Predicting Grasp Contact via Thermal Imaging,"Grasping and manipulating objects is an important human skill. Since hand-object contact is fundamental to grasping, capturing it can lead to important insights. However, observing contact through external sensors is challenging because of occlusion and the complexity of the human hand. We present ContactDB, a novel dataset of contact maps for household objects that captures the rich hand-object contact that occurs during grasping, enabled by use of a thermal camera. Participants in our study grasped 3D printed objects with a post-grasp functional intent. ContactDB includes 3750 3D meshes of 50 household objects textured with contact maps and 375K frames of synchronized RGB-D+thermal images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset that records detailed contact maps for human grasps. Analysis of this data shows the influence of functional intent and object size on grasping, the tendency to touch/avoid 'active areas', and the high frequency of palm and proximal finger contact. Finally, we train state-of-the art image translation and 3D convolution algorithms to predict diverse contact patterns from object shape.

20,Robust Subspace Clustering With Independent and Piecewise Identically Distributed Noise Modeling,"Most of the existing subspace clustering (SC) frameworks assume that the noise contaminating the data is generated by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) source, where the Gaussianity is often imposed. Though these assumptions greatly simplify the underlying problems, they do not hold in many real-world applications. For instance, in face clustering, the noise is usually caused by random occlusions, local variations and unconstrained illuminations, which is essentially structural and hence satisfies neither the i.i.d. property nor the Gaussianity.  In this work, we propose an independent and piecewise identically distributed (i.p.i.d.) noise model, where the i.i.d. property only holds locally. We demonstrate that the i.p.i.d. model better characterizes the noise encountered in practical scenarios, and accommodates the traditional i.i.d. model as a special case. Assisted by this generalized noise model, we design an information theoretic learning (ITL) framework for robust SC through a novel minimum weighted error entropy (MWEE) criterion. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed SC scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Robust,Subspace,Clustering,With,Independent,and,Piecewise,Identically,Distributed,Noise,Modeling"
21,What Correspondences Reveal About Unknown Camera and Motion Models?,"In two-view geometry, camera models and motion types are used as key knowledge along with the image point correspondences in order to solve several key problems of 3D vision. Problems such as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and camera self-calibration are tackled under the assumptions of a specific camera projection model and motion type. However, these key assumptions may not be always justified, i.e.., we may often know neither the camera model nor the motion type beforehand. In that context, one can extract only the point correspondences between images. From such correspondences, recovering two-view relationship --expressed by the unknown camera model and motion type-- remains to be an unsolved problem. In this paper, we tackle this problem in two steps. First, we propose a method that computes the correct two-view relationship in the presence of noise and outliers. Later, we study different possibilities to disambiguate the obtained relationships into camera model and motion type. By extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data, we verify our theory and assumptions in practical settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"What,Correspondences,Reveal,About,Unknown,Camera,and,Motion,Models?"

Unlike previous approaches that heavily rely on assumptions of specific reflectances and light source distributions, our method is able to determine both shape and light directions of a scene with unknown arbitrary reflectances observed under unknown varying light directions. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-stage deep learning architecture, called SDPS-Net, which can effectively take advantage of intermediate supervision, resulting in reduced learning difficulty compared to a single-stage model. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms previous uncalibrated photometric stereo methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Calibrating,Deep,Photometric,Stereo,Networks"

Argoverse includes sensor data collected by a fleet of autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh and Miami as well as 3D tracking annotations, 300k extracted interesting vehicle trajectories, and rich semantic maps. The sensor data consists of 360 degree images from 7 cameras with overlapping fields of view, forward-facing stereo imagery, 3D point clouds from long range LiDAR, and 6-DOF pose.  Our 290km of mapped lanes contain rich geometric and semantic metadata which are not currently available in any public dataset. All data is released under a Creative Commons license at Argoverse.org. In baseline experiments, we use map information such as lane direction, driveable area, and ground height to improve the accuracy of 3D object tracking. We use 3D object tracking to mine for more than 300k interesting vehicle trajectories to create a trajectory forecasting benchmark. Motion forecasting experiments ranging in complexity from classical methods (k-NN) to LSTMs demonstrate that using detailed vector maps with lane-level information substantially reduces prediction error.

24,Side Window Filtering,"Local windows are routinely used in computer vision and almost without exception the center of the window is aligned with the pixels being processed. We show that this conventional wisdom is not universally applicable. When a pixel is on an edge, placing the center of the window on the pixel is one of the fundamental reasons that cause many filtering algorithms to blur the edges. Based on this insight, we propose a new Side Window Filtering (SWF) technique which aligns the window's side or corner with the pixel being processed. The SWF technique is surprisingly simple yet theoretically rooted and very effective in practice. We show that many traditional linear and nonlinear filters can be easily implemented under the SWF framework. Extensive analysis and experiments show that implementing the SWF principle can significantly improve their edge preserving capabilities and achieve state of the art performances in applications such as image smoothing, denoising, enhancement, structure-preserving texture-removing, mutual-structure extraction, and HDR tone mapping. In addition to image filtering, we further show that the SWF principle can be extended to other applications involving the use of a local window. Using colorization by optimization as an example, we demonstrate that implementing the SWF principle can effectively prevent artifacts such as color leakage associated with the conventional implementation. Given the ubiquity of window based operations in computer vision, the new SWF technique is likely to benefit many more applications.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Side,Window,Filtering"
25,Defense Against Adversarial Images Using Web-Scale Nearest-Neighbor Search,"A plethora of recent work has shown that convolutional networks are not robust to adversarial images: images that are created by perturbing a sample from the data distribution as to maximize the loss on the perturbed example. In this work, we hypothesize that adversarial perturbations move the image away from the image manifold in the sense that there exists no physical process that could have produced the adversarial image. This hypothesis suggests that a successful defense mechanism against adversarial images should aim to project the images back onto the image manifold. We study such defense mechanisms, which approximate the projection onto the unknown image manifold by a nearest-neighbor search against a web-scale image database containing tens of billions of images. Empirical evaluations of this defense strategy on ImageNet suggest that it very effective in attack settings in which the adversary does not have access to the image database. We also propose two novel attack methods to break nearest-neighbor defense settings and show conditions under which nearest-neighbor defense fails. We perform a series of ablation experiments, which suggest that there is a trade-off between robustness and accuracy between as we use features from deeper in the network, that a large index size (hundreds of millions) is crucial to get good performance, and that careful construction of database is crucial for robustness against nearest-neighbor attacks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Defense,Against,Adversarial,Images,Using,Web-Scale,Nearest-Neighbor,Search"

CRIB is coupled with a new 3D object dataset, Toys-200, that contains 200 unique toy-like object instances, and is also compatible with existing 3D datasets. Through extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art incremental learning algorithms, we find the novel empirical result that repetition can significantly ameliorate the effects of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we find that in certain cases repetition allows for performance approaching that of batch learning algorithms.

27,IP102: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Insect Pest Recognition,"Insect pests are one of the main factors affecting agricultural product yield. Accurate recognition of insect pests facilitates timely preventive measures to avoid economic losses. However, the existing datasets for the visual classification  task mainly focus on common objects, e.g., flowers and dogs. This limits the application of powerful deep learning technology on specific domains like the agricultural field. In this paper, we collect a large-scale dataset named IP102 for insect pest recognition. Specifically, it contains more than 75, 000 images belonging to 102 categories, which exhibit a natural long-tailed distribution. In  addition, we annotate about 19, 000 images with bounding boxes for object detection. The IP102 has a hierarchical taxonomy and the insect pests which mainly affect one specific agricultural product are grouped into the same upperlevel category. Furthermore, we perform several baseline experiments on the IP102 dataset, including handcrafted and deep feature based classification methods.

28,CityFlow: A City-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Target Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking and Re-Identification,"Urban traffic optimization using traffic cameras as sensors is driving the need to advance state-of-the-art multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking. This work introduces CityFlow, a city-scale traffic camera dataset consisting of more than 3 hours of synchronized HD videos from 40 cameras across 10 intersections, with the longest distance between two simultaneous cameras being 2.5 km. To the best of our knowledge, CityFlow is the largest-scale dataset in terms of spatial coverage and the number of cameras/videos in an urban environment. The dataset contains more than 200K annotated bounding boxes covering a wide range of scenes, viewing angles, vehicle models, and urban traffic flow conditions. Camera geometry and calibration information are provided to aid spatio-temporal analysis. In addition, a subset of the benchmark is made available for the task of image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID). We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of baselines/state-of-the-art approaches in MTMC tracking, multi-target single-camera (MTSC) tracking, object detection, and image-based ReID on this dataset, analyzing the impact of different network architectures, loss functions, spatio-temporal models and their combinations on task effectiveness. An evaluation server is launched with the release of our benchmark at the 2019 AI City Challenge (https://www.aicitychallenge.org/) that allows researchers to compare the performance of their newest techniques.

29,Social-IQ: A Question Answering Benchmark for Artificial Social Intelligence,"As intelligent systems increasingly blend into our everyday life, artificial social intelligence becomes a prominent area of research. Intelligent systems must be socially intelligent in order to comprehend human intents and maintain a rich level of interaction with humans. Human language offers a unique unconstrained approach to probe through questions and reason through answers about social situations. This unconstrained approach extends previous attempts to model social intelligence through numeric supervision (e.g. sentiment and emotions labels). In this paper, we introduce Social-IQ, a unconstrained benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate socially intelligent technologies. By providing a rich source of open-ended questions and answers, Social-IQ opens the door to explainable social intelligence. The dataset contains rigorously annotated and validated videos, questions and answers, as well as annotations for the complexity level of each question and answer. Social-IQ contains 1,250 natural in-the-wild social situations, 7,500 questions and 52,500 correct and incorrect answers. Although humans can reason about social situations with very high accuracy (95.08%), existing state-of-the-art computational models struggle on this task. As a result, Social-IQ brings novel challenges that will spark future research in social intelligence modeling, visual reasoning, and multimodal question answering (QA).",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Social-IQ:,A,Question,Answering,Benchmark,for,Artificial,Social,Intelligence"
30,UPSNet: A Unified Panoptic Segmentation Network,"In this paper, we propose a unified panoptic segmentation network (UPSNet) for tackling the newly proposed panoptic segmentation task. On top of a single backbone residual network, we first design a deformable convolution based semantic segmentation head and a Mask R-CNN style instance segmentation head which solve these two subtasks simultaneously. More importantly, we introduce a parameter-free panoptic head which solves the panoptic segmentation via pixel-wise classification. It first leverages the logits from the previous two heads and then innovatively expands the representation for enabling prediction of an extra unknown class which helps better resolving the conflicts between semantic and instance segmentation. Besides, it handles the challenge caused by the varying number of instances and permits back propagation to the bottom modules in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results on Cityscapes, COCO and our internal dataset demonstrate that our UPSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster inference.

31,JSIS3D: Joint Semantic-Instance Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds With Multi-Task Pointwise Networks and Multi-Value Conditional Random Fields,"Deep learning techniques have become the to-go models for most vision-related tasks on 2D images. However, their power has not been fully realised on several tasks in 3D space, e.g., 3D scene understanding. In this work, we jointly address the problems of semantic and instance segmentation of 3D point clouds. Specifically, we develop a multi-task pointwise network that simultaneously performs two tasks: predicting the semantic classes of 3D points and embedding the points into high-dimensional vectors so that points of the same object instance are represented by similar embeddings. We then propose a multi-value conditional random field model to incorporate the semantic and instance labels and formulate the problem of semantic and instance segmentation as jointly optimising labels in the field model. The proposed method is thoroughly evaluated and compared with existing methods on different indoor scene datasets including S3DIS and SceneNN. Experimental results showed the robustness of the proposed joint semantic-instance segmentation scheme over its single components. Our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"JSIS3D:,Joint,Semantic-Instance,Segmentation,of,3D,Point,Clouds,With,Multi-Task,Pointwise,Networks,and,Multi-Value,Conditional,Random,Fields"
32,Instance Segmentation by Jointly Optimizing Spatial Embeddings and Clustering Bandwidth,"Current state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods are not suited for real-time applications like autonomous driving, which require fast execution times at high accuracy. Although the currently dominant proposal-based methods have high accuracy, they are slow and generate masks at a fixed and low resolution. Proposal-free methods, by contrast, can generate masks at high resolution and are often faster, but fail to reach the same accuracy as the proposal-based methods. In this work we propose a new clustering loss function for proposal-free instance segmentation. The loss function pulls the spatial embeddings of pixels belonging to the same instance together and jointly learns an instance-specific clustering bandwidth, maximizing the intersection-over-union of the resulting instance mask. When combined with a fast architecture, the network can perform instance segmentation in real-time while maintaining a high accuracy. We evaluate our method on the challenging Cityscapes benchmark and achieve top results (5% improvement over Mask R-CNN) at more than 10 fps on 2MP images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Instance,Segmentation,by,Jointly,Optimizing,Spatial,Embeddings,and,Clustering,Bandwidth"
33,DeepCO3: Deep Instance Co-Segmentation by Co-Peak Search and Co-Saliency Detection,"In this paper, we address a new task called instance co-segmentation. Given a set of images jointly covering object instances of a specific category, instance co-segmentation aims to identify all of these instances and segment each of them, i.e. generating one mask for each instance. This task is important since instance-level segmentation is preferable for humans and many vision applications. It is also challenging because no pixel-wise annotated training data are available and the number of instances in each image is unknown. We solve this task by dividing it into two sub-tasks, co-peak search and instance mask segmentation. In the former sub-task, we develop a CNN-based network to detect the co-peaks as well as co-saliency maps for a pair of images. A co-peak has two endpoints, one in each image, that are local maxima in the response maps and similar to each other. Thereby, the two endpoints are potentially covered by a pair of instances of the same category. In the latter subtask, we design a ranking function that takes the detected co-peaks and co-saliency maps as inputs and can select the object proposals to produce the final results. Our method for instance co-segmentation and its variant for object colocalization are evaluated on four datasets, and achieve favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

34,Improving Semantic Segmentation via Video Propagation and Label Relaxation,"Semantic segmentation requires large amounts of pixel-wise annotations to learn accurate models. In this paper, we present a video prediction-based methodology to scale up training sets by synthesizing new training samples in order to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We exploit video prediction models' ability to predict future frames in order to also predict future labels. A joint propagation strategy is also proposed to alleviate mis-alignments in synthesized samples. We demonstrate that training segmentation models on datasets augmented by the synthesized samples leads to significant improvements in accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a novel boundary label relaxation technique that makes training robust to annotation noise and propagation artifacts along object boundaries. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art mIoUs of 83.5% on Cityscapes and 82.9% on CamVid. Our single model, without model ensembles, achieves 72.8% mIoU on the KITTI semantic segmentation test set, which surpasses the winning entry of the ROB challenge 2018.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Improving,Semantic,Segmentation,via,Video,Propagation,and,Label,Relaxation"
35,Accel: A Corrective Fusion Network for Efficient Semantic Segmentation on Video,"We present Accel, a novel semantic video segmentation system that achieves high accuracy at low inference cost by combining the predictions of two network branches: (1) a reference branch that extracts high-detail features on a reference keyframe, and warps these features forward using frame-to-frame optical flow estimates, and (2) an update branch that computes features of adjustable quality on the current frame, performing a temporal update at each video frame. The modularity of the update branch, where feature subnetworks of varying layer depth can be inserted (e.g. ResNet-18 to ResNet-101), enables operation over a new, state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off spectrum. Over this curve, Accel models achieve both higher accuracy and faster inference times than the closest comparable single-frame segmentation networks. In general, Accel significantly outperforms previous work on efficient semantic video segmentation, correcting warping-related error that compounds on datasets with complex dynamics. Accel is end-to-end trainable and highly modular: the reference network, the optical flow network, and the update network can each be selected independently, depending on application requirements, and then jointly fine-tuned. The result is a robust, general system for fast, high-accuracy semantic segmentation on video.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Accel:,A,Corrective,Fusion,Network,for,Efficient,Semantic,Segmentation,on,Video"
36,Shape2Motion: Joint Analysis of Motion Parts and Attributes From 3D Shapes,"For the task of mobility analysis of 3D shapes, we propose joint analysis for simultaneous motion part segmentation and motion attribute estimation, taking a single 3D model as input. The problem is significantly different from those tackled in the existing works which assume the availability of either a pre-existing shape segmentation or multiple 3D models in different motion states. To that end, we develop Shape2Motion which takes a single 3D point cloud as input, and jointly computes a mobility-oriented segmentation and the associated motion attributes. Shape2Motion is comprised of two deep neural networks designed for mobility proposal generation and mobility optimization, respectively. The key contribution of these networks is the novel motion-driven features and losses used in both motion part segmentation and motion attribute estimation. This is based on the observation that the movement of a functional part preserves the shape structure. We evaluate Shape2Motion with a newly proposed benchmark for mobility analysis of 3D shapes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance both in terms of motion part segmentation and motion attribute estimation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Shape2Motion:,Joint,Analysis,of,Motion,Parts,and,Attributes,From,3D,Shapes"
37,Semantic Correlation Promoted Shape-Variant Context for Segmentation,"Context is essential for semantic segmentation. Due to the diverse shapes of objects and their complex layout in various scene images, the spatial scales and shapes of contexts for different objects have very large variation. It is thus ineffective or inefficient to aggregate various context information from a predefined fixed region. In this work, we propose to generate a scale- and shape-variant semantic mask for each pixel to confine its contextual region. To this end, we first propose a novel paired convolution to infer the semantic correlation of the pair and based on that to generate a shape mask. Using the inferred spatial scope of the contextual region, we propose a shape-variant convolution, of which the receptive field is controlled by the shape mask that varies with the appearance of input. In this way, the proposed network aggregates the context information of a pixel from its semantic-correlated region instead of a predefined fixed region. Furthermore, this work also proposes a labeling denoising model to reduce wrong predictions caused by the noisy low-level features. Without bells and whistles, the proposed segmentation network achieves new state-of-the-arts consistently on the six public segmentation datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semantic,Correlation,Promoted,Shape-Variant,Context,for,Segmentation"
38,Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network for Point Cloud Analysis,"Point cloud analysis is very challenging, as the shape implied in irregular points is difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose RS-CNN, namely, Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network, which extends regular grid CNN to irregular configuration for point cloud analysis. The key to RS-CNN is learning from relation, i.e., the geometric topology constraint among points. Specifically, the convolutional weight for local point set is forced to learn a high-level relation expression from predefined geometric priors, between a sampled point from this point set and the others. In this way, an inductive local representation with explicit reasoning about the spatial layout of points can be obtained, which leads to much shape awareness and robustness. With this convolution as a basic operator, RS-CNN, a hierarchical architecture can be developed to achieve contextual shape-aware learning for point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across three tasks verify RS-CNN achieves the state of the arts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Relation-Shape,Convolutional,Neural,Network,for,Point,Cloud,Analysis"
39,Enhancing Diversity of Defocus Blur Detectors via Cross-Ensemble Network,"Defocus blur detection (DBD) is a fundamental yet challenging topic, since the homogeneous region is obscure and the transition from the focused area to the unfocused region is gradual. Recent DBD methods make progress through exploring deeper or wider networks with the expense of high memory and computation. In this paper, we propose a novel learning strategy by breaking DBD problem into multiple smaller defocus blur detectors and thus estimate errors can cancel out each other. Our focus is the diversity enhancement via cross-ensemble network. Specifically, we design an end-to-end network composed of two logical parts: feature extractor network (FENet) and defocus blur detector cross-ensemble network (DBD-CENet). FENet is constructed to extract low-level features. Then the features are fed into DBD-CENet containing two parallel-branches for learning two groups of defocus blur detectors. For each individual, we design cross-negative and self-negative correlations and an error function to enhance ensemble diversity and balance individual accuracy. Finally, the multiple defocus blur detectors are combined with a uniformly weighted average to obtain the final DBD map. Experimental results indicate the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy and speed when compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Enhancing,Diversity,of,Defocus,Blur,Detectors,via,Cross-Ensemble,Network"
40,BubbleNets: Learning to Select the Guidance Frame in Video Object Segmentation by Deep Sorting Frames,"Semi-supervised video object segmentation has made significant progress on real and challenging videos in recent years. The current paradigm for segmentation methods and benchmark datasets is to segment objects in video provided a single annotation in the first frame. However, we find that segmentation performance across the entire video varies dramatically when selecting an alternative frame for annotation. This paper addresses the problem of learning to suggest the single best frame across the video for user annotation-this is, in fact, never the first frame of video. We achieve this by introducing BubbleNets, a novel deep sorting network that learns to select frames using a  performance-based loss function that enables the conversion of expansive amounts of training examples from already existing datasets. Using BubbleNets, we are able to achieve an 11% relative improvement in segmentation performance on the DAVIS benchmark without any changes to the underlying method of segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"BubbleNets:,Learning,to,Select,the,Guidance,Frame,in,Video,Object,Segmentation,by,Deep,Sorting,Frames"
41,Collaborative Global-Local Networks for Memory-Efficient Segmentation of Ultra-High Resolution Images,"Segmentation of ultra-high resolution images is increasingly demanded, yet poses significant challenges for algorithm efficiency, in particular considering the (GPU) memory limits. Current approaches either downsample an ultra-high resolution image, or crop it into small patches for separate processing. In either way, the loss of local fine details or global contextual information results in limited segmentation accuracy. We propose collaborative Global-Local Networks (GLNet) to effectively preserve both global and local information in a highly memory-efficient manner. GLNet is composed of a global branch and a local branch, taking the downsampled entire image and its cropped local patches as respective inputs. For segmentation, GLNet deeply fuses feature maps from two branches, capturing both the high-resolution fine structures from  zoomed-in local patches and the contextual dependency from the  downsampled input. To further resolve the potential class imbalance problem between background and foreground regions, we present a coarse-to-fine variant of GLNet, also being memory-efficient. Extensive experiments and analyses have been performed on three real-world ultra-high aerial and medical image datasets (resolution up to 30 million pixels). With only one single 1080Ti GPU and less than 2GB memory used, our GLNet yields high-quality segmentation results, and achieves much more competitive accuracy-memory usage trade-offs compared to state-of-the-arts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Collaborative,Global-Local,Networks,for,Memory-Efficient,Segmentation,of,Ultra-High,Resolution,Images"

The main proposition is that the first neighbor of each sample is all one needs to discover large chains and finding the groups in the data. In contrast to most existing clustering algorithms our method does not require any hyper-parameters, distance thresholds and/or the need to specify the number of clusters. The proposed algorithm belongs to the family of hierarchical agglomerative methods. The technique has a very low computational overhead, is easily scalable and applicable to large practical problems. Evaluation on well known datasets from different domains ranging between 1077 and 8.1 million samples shows substantial performance gains when compared to the existing clustering techniques.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Efficient,Parameter-Free,Clustering,Using,First,Neighbor,Relations"
43,Learning Personalized Modular Network Guided by Structured Knowledge,"The dominant deep learning approaches use a ""one-size-fits-all"" paradigm with the hope that underlying characteristics of diverse inputs can be captured via a fixed structure. They also overlook the importance of explicitly modeling feature hierarchy. However, complex real-world tasks often require discovering diverse reasoning paths for different inputs to achieve satisfying predictions, especially for challenging large-scale recognition tasks with complex label relations. In this paper, we treat the structured commonsense knowledge (e.g. concept hierarchy) as the guidance of customizing more powerful and explainable network structures for distinct inputs, leading to dynamic and individualized inference paths. Give an off-the-shelf large network configuration, the proposed Personalized Modular Network (PMN) is learned by selectively activating a sequence of network modules where each of them is designated to recognize particular levels of structured knowledge. Learning semantic configurations and activation of modules to align well with structured knowledge can be regarded as a decision-making procedure, which is solved by a new graph-based reinforcement learning algorithm. Experiments on three semantic segmentation tasks and classification tasks show our PMN can achieve superior performance with the reduced number of network modules while discovering personalized and explainable module configurations for each input.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Personalized,Modular,Network,Guided,by,Structured,Knowledge"
44,A Generative Appearance Model for End-To-End Video Object Segmentation,"One of the fundamental challenges in video object segmentation is to find an effective representation of the target and background appearance. The best performing approaches resort to extensive fine-tuning of a convolutional neural network for this purpose. Besides being prohibitively expensive, this strategy cannot be truly trained end-to-end since the online fine-tuning procedure is not integrated into the offline training of the network.  To address these issues, we propose a network architecture that learns a powerful representation of the target and background appearance in a single forward pass. The introduced appearance module learns a probabilistic generative model of target and background feature distributions. Given a new image, it predicts the posterior class probabilities, providing a highly discriminative cue, which is processed in later network modules. Both the learning and prediction stages of our appearance module are fully differentiable, enabling true end-to-end training of the entire segmentation pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video object segmentation benchmarks. We close the gap to approaches based on online fine-tuning on DAVIS17, while operating at 15 FPS on a single GPU. Furthermore, our method outperforms all published approaches on the large-scale YouTube-VOS dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Generative,Appearance,Model,for,End-To-End,Video,Object,Segmentation"

While solutions already exist, our network is uniquely flexible by design: it can be manipulated at runtime to enforce new constraints on the final output. As examples, we show that it can be modified to perform tasks such as fast photorealistic style transfer, or fast video style transfer with short term consistency, with no retraining. This flexibility stems from the proposed architecture which is obtained by unrolling the gradient descent algorithm used in [Gatys et al.].

46,Cross Domain Model Compression by Structurally Weight Sharing,"Regular model compression methods focus on RGB input. While cross domain tasks demand more DNN models, each domain often needs its own model. Consequently, for such tasks, the storage cost, memory footprint and computation cost increase dramatically compared to single RGB input. Moreover, the distinct appearance and special structure in cross domain tasks make it difficult to directly apply regular compression methods on it. In this paper, thus, we propose a new robust cross domain model compression method. Specifically, the proposed method compress cross domain models by structurally weight sharing, which is achieved by regularizing the models with graph embedding at training time. Due to the channel wise weights sharing, the proposed method can reduce computation cost without specially designed algorithm. In the experiments, the proposed method achieves state of the art results on two diverse tasks: action recognition and RGB-D scene recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cross,Domain,Model,Compression,by,Structurally,Weight,Sharing"
47,TraVeLGAN: Image-To-Image Translation by Transformation Vector Learning,"Interest in image-to-image translation has grown substantially in recent years with the success of unsupervised models based on the cycle-consistency assumption. The achievements of these models have been limited to a particular subset of domains where this assumption yields good results, namely homogeneous domains that are characterized by style or texture differences. We tackle the challenging problem of image-to-image translation where the domains are defined by high-level shapes and contexts, as well as including significant clutter and heterogeneity. For this purpose, we introduce a novel GAN based on preserving intra-domain vector transformations in a latent space learned by a siamese network. The traditional GAN system introduced a discriminator network to guide the generator into generating images in the target domain. To this two-network system we add a third: a siamese network that guides the generator so that each original image shares semantics with its generated version. With this new three-network system, we no longer need to constrain the generators with the ubiquitous cycle-consistency restraint or any other autoencoding regularization. As a result, the generators can learn mappings between more complex domains that differ from each other by more than just style or texture. We demonstrate our model by mapping between high-resolution, arbitrarily chosen classes from the Imagenet dataset completely without pre-processing such as cropping, centering, or filtering unrepresentative images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"TraVeLGAN:,Image-To-Image,Translation,by,Transformation,Vector,Learning"
48,Deep Robust Subjective Visual Property Prediction in Crowdsourcing,"The problem of estimating subjective visual properties (SVP) of images (e.g., Shoes A is more comfortable than B) is gaining rising attention. Due to its highly subjective nature, different annotators often exhibit different interpretations of scales when adopting absolute value tests. Therefore, recent investigations turn to collect pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing platforms. However,  crowdsourcing data usually contains outliers. For this purpose, it is desired to develop a robust model for learning SVP from crowdsourced noisy annotations. In this paper, we construct a deep SVP prediction model which not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations. Specifically, we construct a comparison multi-graph based on the collected annotations, where different labeling results correspond to edges with different directions between two vertexes. Then, we propose a generalized deep probabilistic framework which consists of an SVP prediction module and an outlier modeling module that work collaboratively and are optimized jointly. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our new approach guarantees promising results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Robust,Subjective,Visual,Property,Prediction,in,Crowdsourcing"

50,Learning Not to Learn: Training Deep Neural Networks With Biased Data,"We propose a novel regularization algorithm to train deep neural networks, in which data at training time is severely biased. Since a neural network efficiently learns data distribution, a network is likely to learn the bias information to categorize input data. It leads to poor performance at test time, if the bias is, in fact, irrelevant to the categorization. In this paper, we formulate a regularization loss based on mutual information between feature embedding and bias. Based on the idea of minimizing this mutual information, we propose an iterative algorithm to unlearn the bias information. We employ an additional network to predict the bias distribution and train the network adversarially against the feature embedding network. At the end of learning, the bias prediction network is not able to predict the bias not because it is poorly trained, but because the feature embedding network successfully unlearns the bias information. We also demonstrate quantitative and qualitative experimental results which show that our algorithm effectively removes the bias information from feature embedding.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Not,to,Learn:,Training,Deep,Neural,Networks,With,Biased,Data"

Most existing architecture search approaches totally neglect the topological characteristics of architectures, which results in complicated architecture with a high inference latency. Motivated by the fact that human-designed networks are elegant in topology with a fast inference speed, we propose a mirror stimuli function inspired by biological cognition theory to extract the abstract topological knowledge of an expert human-design network (ResNeXt). To avoid raising a too strong prior over the search space, we introduce inverse reinforcement learning to train the mirror stimuli function and exploit it as a heuristic guidance for architecture search, easily generalized to different architecture search algorithms. On CIFAR-10, the best architecture searched by our proposed IRLAS achieves 2.60% error rate. For ImageNet mobile setting, our model achieves a state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy 75.28%, while being 2 4x faster than most auto-generated architectures.

52,Learning for Single-Shot Confidence Calibration in Deep Neural Networks Through Stochastic Inferences,"We propose a generic framework to calibrate accuracy and confidence of a prediction in deep neural networks through stochastic inferences. We interpret stochastic regularization using a Bayesian model, and analyze the relation between predictive uncertainty of networks and variance of the prediction scores obtained by stochastic inferences for a single example. Our empirical study shows that the accuracy and the score of a prediction are highly correlated with the variance of multiple stochastic inferences given by stochastic depth or dropout. Motivated by this observation, we design a novel variance-weighted confidence-integrated loss function that is composed of two cross-entropy loss terms with respect to ground-truth and uniform distribution, which are balanced by variance of stochastic prediction scores. The proposed loss function enables us to learn deep neural networks that predict confidence calibrated scores using a single inference. Our algorithm presents outstanding confidence calibration performance and improves classification accuracy when combined with two popular stochastic regularization techniques---stochastic depth and dropout---in multiple models and datasets; it alleviates overconfidence issue in deep neural networks significantly by training networks to achieve prediction accuracy proportional to confidence of prediction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,for,Single-Shot,Confidence,Calibration,in,Deep,Neural,Networks,Through,Stochastic,Inferences"
53,Attention-Based Adaptive Selection of Operations for Image Restoration in the Presence of Unknown Combined Distortions,"Many studies have been conducted so far on image restoration, the problem of restoring a clean image from its distorted version. There are many different types of distortion affecting image quality. Previous studies have focused on single types of distortion, proposing methods for removing them. However, image quality degrades due to multiple factors in the real world. Thus, depending on applications, e.g., vision for autonomous cars or surveillance cameras, we need to be able to deal with multiple combined distortions with unknown mixture ratios. For this purpose, we propose a simple yet effective layer architecture of neural networks. It performs multiple operations in parallel, which are weighted by an attention mechanism to enable selection of proper operations depending on the input. The layer can be stacked to form a deep network, which is differentiable and thus can be trained in an end-to-end fashion by gradient descent.

Specifically, our proposed method automatically learns the group structure in the training stage in a fully end-to-end manner, leading to a better structure than the existing pre-defined, two-steps, or iterative strategies. Moreover, our method can be further combined with depthwise separable convolution, resulting in 5 times acceleration than the vanilla Resnet50 on single CPU. An additional advantage is that in our FLGC the number of groups can be set as any value, but not necessarily 2^k as in most existing methods, meaning better tradeoff between accuracy and speed. As evaluated in our experiments, our method achieves better performance than existing learnable group convolution and standard group convolution when using the same number of groups.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fully,Learnable,Group,Convolution,for,Acceleration,of,Deep,Neural,Networks"
55,EIGEN: Ecologically-Inspired GENetic Approach for Neural Network Structure Searching From Scratch,"Designing the structure of neural networks is considered one of the most challenging tasks in deep learning, especially when there is few prior knowledge about the task domain. In this paper, we propose an Ecologically-Inspired GENetic (EIGEN) approach that uses the concept of succession, extinction, mimicry, and gene duplication to search neural network structure from scratch with poorly initialized simple network and few constraints forced during the evolution, as we assume no prior knowledge about the task domain. Specifically, we first use primary succession to rapidly evolve a population of poorly initialized neural network structures into a more diverse population, followed by a secondary succession stage for fine-grained searching based on the networks from the primary succession. Extinction is applied in both stages to reduce computational cost. Mimicry is employed during the entire evolution process to help the inferior networks imitate the behavior of a superior network and gene duplication is utilized to duplicate the learned blocks of novel structures, both of which help to find better network structures. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve similar or better performance compared to the existing genetic approaches with dramatically reduced computation cost. For example, the network discovered by our approach on CIFAR-100 dataset achieves 78.1% test accuracy under 120 GPU hours, compared to 77.0% test accuracy in more than 65, 536  GPU hours in [35].",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"EIGEN:,Ecologically-Inspired,GENetic,Approach,for,Neural,Network,Structure,Searching,From,Scratch"
56,Deep Incremental Hashing Network for Efficient Image Retrieval,"Hashing has shown great potential in large-scale image retrieval due to its storage and computation efficiency, especially the recent deep supervised hashing methods. To achieve promising performance, deep supervised hashing methods require a large amount of training data from different classes. However, when images of new categories emerge, existing deep hashing methods have to retrain the CNN model and generate hash codes for all the database images again, which is impractical for large-scale retrieval system. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing framework, called Deep Incremental Hashing Network (DIHN), for learning hash codes in an incremental manner. DIHN learns the hash codes for the new coming images directly, while keeping the old ones unchanged. Simultaneously, a deep hash function for query set is learned by preserving the similarities between training points. Extensive experiments on two widely used image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DIHN framework can significantly decrease the training time while keeping the state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Incremental,Hashing,Network,for,Efficient,Image,Retrieval"
57,"Robustness via Curvature Regularization, and Vice Versa","State-of-the-art classifiers have been shown to be largely vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. One of the most effective strategies to improve robustness is adversarial training. In this paper, we investigate the effect of adversarial training on the geometry of the classification landscape and decision boundaries. We show in particular that adversarial training leads to a significant decrease in the curvature of the loss surface with respect to inputs, leading to a drastically more ""linear"" behaviour of the network. Using a locally quadratic approximation, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of a strong relation between large robustness and small curvature. To further show the importance of reduced curvature for improving the robustness, we propose a new regularizer that directly minimizes curvature of the loss surface, and leads to adversarial robustness that is on par with adversarial training. Besides being a more efficient and principled alternative to adversarial training, the proposed regularizer confirms our claims on the importance of exhibiting quasi-linear behavior in the vicinity of data points in order to achieve robustness.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Robustness,via,Curvature,Regularization,,and,Vice,Versa"

Although most attacks usually change values of many image's pixels, it has been shown that deep networks are also vulnerable to sparse alterations of the input. However, no computationally efficient method has been proposed to compute sparse perturbations. In this paper, we exploit the low mean curvature of the decision boundary, and propose SparseFool, a geometry inspired sparse attack that controls the sparsity of the perturbations. Extensive evaluations show that our approach computes sparse perturbations very fast, and scales efficiently to high dimensional data. We further analyze the transferability and the visual effects of the perturbations, and show the existence of shared semantic information across the images and the networks. Finally, we show that adversarial training can only slightly improve the robustness against sparse additive perturbations computed with SparseFool.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SparseFool:,A,Few,Pixels,Make,a,Big,Difference"

In this work, we propose a post-hoc, optimization based visual explanation method, which highlights the evidence in the input image for a specific prediction. Our approach is based on a novel technique to defend against adversarial evidence (i.e. faulty evidence due to artefacts) by filtering gradients during optimization. The defense does not depend on human-tuned parameters. It enables explanations which are both fine-grained and preserve the characteristics of images, such as edges and colors. The explanations are interpretable, suited for visualizing detailed evidence and can be tested as they are valid model inputs. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our approach on a multitude of models and datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Interpretable,and,Fine-Grained,Visual,Explanations,for,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"
60,Structured Pruning of Neural Networks With Budget-Aware Regularization,"Pruning methods have shown to be effective at reducing the size of deep neural networks while keeping accuracy almost intact. Among the most effective methods are those that prune a network while training it with a sparsity prior loss and learnable dropout parameters. A shortcoming of these approaches however is that neither the size nor the inference speed of the pruned network can be controlled directly; yet this is a key feature for targeting deployment of CNNs on low-power hardware. To overcome this, we introduce a budgeted regularized pruning framework for deep CNNs. Our approach naturally fits into traditional neural network training as it consists of a learnable masking layer, a novel budget-aware objective function, and the use of knowledge distillation. We also provide insights on how to prune a residual network and how this can lead to new architectures. Experimental results reveal that CNNs pruned with our method are more accurate and less compute-hungry than state-of-the-art methods. Also, our approach is more effective at preventing accuracy collapse in case of severe pruning; this allows pruning factors of up to 16x without significant accuracy drop.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Structured,Pruning,of,Neural,Networks,With,Budget-Aware,Regularization"
61,MBS: Macroblock Scaling for CNN Model Reduction,"In this paper we propose the macroblock scaling (MBS) algorithm, which can be applied to various CNN architectures to reduce their model size. MBS adaptively reduces each CNN macroblock depending on its information redundancy measured by our proposed  effective flops. Empirical studies conducted with ImageNet and CIFAR-10 attest that MBS can reduce the model size of some already compact CNN models, e.g., MobileNetV2 (25.03% further reduction) and ShuffleNet (20.74%), and even ultra-deep ones such as ResNet-101 (51.67%) and ResNet-1202 (72.71%) with negligible accuracy degradation. MBS also performs better reduction at a much lower cost than the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods do. MBS's simplicity and efficiency, its flexibility to work with any CNN model, and its scalability to work with models of any depth make it an attractive choice for CNN model size reduction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MBS:,Macroblock,Scaling,for,CNN,Model,Reduction"
62,Fast Neural Architecture Search of Compact Semantic Segmentation Models via Auxiliary Cells,"Automated design of neural network architectures tailored for a specific task is an extremely promising, albeit inherently difficult, avenue to explore. While most results in this domain have been achieved on image classification and language modelling problems, here we concentrate on dense per-pixel tasks, in particular, semantic image segmentation using fully convolutional networks. In contrast to the aforementioned areas, the design choices of a fully convolutional network require several changes, ranging from the sort of operations that need to be used - e.g., dilated convolutions - to a solving of a more difficult optimisation problem. In this work, we are particularly interested in searching for high-performance compact segmentation architectures, able to run in real-time using limited resources. To achieve that, we intentionally over-parameterise the architecture during the training time via a set of auxiliary cells that provide an intermediate supervisory signal and can be omitted during the evaluation phase.  The design of the auxiliary cell is emitted by a controller, a neural network with the fixed structure trained using reinforcement learning. More crucially, we demonstrate how to efficiently search for these architectures within limited time and computational budgets. In particular, we rely on a progressive strategy that terminates non-promising architectures from being further trained, and on Polyak averaging coupled with knowledge distillation to speed-up the convergence. Quantitatively, in 8 GPU-days our approach discovers a set of architectures performing on-par with state-of-the-art among compact models on the semantic segmentation, pose estimation and depth prediction tasks.

63,Generating 3D Adversarial Point Clouds,"Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples which are carefully crafted instances to cause the models to make wrong predictions. While adversarial examples for 2D images and CNNs have been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to 3D data such as point clouds. Given many safety-critical 3D applications such as autonomous driving, it is important to study how adversarial point clouds could affect current deep 3D models. In this work, we propose several novel algorithms to craft adversarial point clouds against PointNet, a widely used deep neural network for point cloud processing. Our algorithms work in two ways: adversarial point perturbation and adversarial point generation. For point perturbation, we shift existing points negligibly. For point generation, we generate either a set of independent and scattered points or a small number (1-3) of point clusters with meaningful shapes such as balls and airplanes which could be hidden in the human psyche. In addition, we formulate six perturbation measurement metrics tailored to the attacks in point clouds and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms on the ModelNet40 3D shape classification dataset. Overall, our attack algorithms achieve a success rate higher than 99% for all targeted attacks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generating,3D,Adversarial,Point,Clouds"
64,Partial Order Pruning: For Best Speed/Accuracy Trade-Off in Neural Architecture Search,"Achieving good speed and accuracy trade-off on a target platform is very important in deploying deep neural networks in real world scenarios. However, most existing automatic architecture search approaches only concentrate on high performance. In this work, we propose an algorithm that can offer better speed/accuracy trade-off of searched networks, which is termed ""Partial Order Pruning"". It prunes the architecture search space with a partial order assumption to automatically search for the architectures with the best speed and accuracy trade-off. Our algorithm explicitly takes profile information about the inference speed on the target platform into consideration. With the proposed algorithm, we present several Dongfeng (DF) networks that provide high accuracy and fast inference speed on various application GPU platforms. By further searching decoder architectures, our DF-Seg real-time segmentation networks yield state-of-the-art speed/accuracy trade-off on both the  target embedded device  and the high-end GPU.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Partial,Order,Pruning:,For,Best,Speed/Accuracy,Trade-Off,in,Neural,Architecture,Search"
65,Memory in Memory: A Predictive Neural Network for Learning Higher-Order Non-Stationarity From Spatiotemporal Dynamics,"Natural spatiotemporal processes can be highly non-stationary in many ways, e.g. the low-level non-stationarity such as spatial correlations or temporal dependencies of local pixel values; and the high-level variations such as the accumulation, deformation or dissipation of radar echoes in precipitation forecasting. From Cramer's Decomposition, any non-stationary process can be decomposed into deterministic, time-variant polynomials, plus a zero-mean stochastic term. By applying differencing operations appropriately, we may turn time-variant polynomials into a constant, making the deterministic component predictable.   However, most previous recurrent neural networks for spatiotemporal prediction do not use the differential signals effectively, and their relatively simple state transition functions prevent them from learning too complicated variations in spacetime. We propose the Memory In Memory (MIM) networks and corresponding recurrent blocks for this purpose. The MIM blocks exploit the differential signals between adjacent recurrent states to model the non-stationary and approximately stationary properties in spatiotemporal dynamics with two cascaded, self-renewed memory modules. By stacking multiple MIM blocks, we could potentially handle higher-order non-stationarity. The MIM networks achieve the state-of-the-art results on four spatiotemporal prediction tasks across both synthetic and real-world datasets. We believe that the general idea of this work can be potentially applied to other time-series forecasting tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Memory,in,Memory:,A,Predictive,Neural,Network,for,Learning,Higher-Order,Non-Stationarity,From,Spatiotemporal,Dynamics"
66,Variational Information Distillation for Knowledge Transfer,Transferring knowledge from a teacher neural network pretrained on the same or a similar task to a student neural network can significantly improve the performance of the student neural network. Existing knowledge transfer approaches match the activations or the corresponding hand-crafted features of the teacher and the student networks. We propose an information-theoretic framework for knowledge transfer which formulates knowledge transfer as maximizing the mutual information between the teacher and the student networks. We compare our method with existing knowledge transfer methods on both knowledge distillation and transfer learning tasks and show that our method consistently outperforms existing methods. We further demonstrate the strength of our method on knowledge transfer across heterogeneous network architectures by transferring knowledge from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on CIFAR-10. The resulting MLP significantly outperforms the-state-of-the-art methods and it achieves similar performance to the CNN with a single convolutional layer.,http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Variational,Information,Distillation,for,Knowledge,Transfer"
67,You Look Twice: GaterNet for Dynamic Filter Selection in CNNs,"The concept of conditional computation for deep nets has been proposed previously to improve model performance by selectively using only parts of the model conditioned on the sample it is processing. In this paper, we investigate input-dependent dynamic filter selection in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The problem is interesting because the idea of forcing different parts of the model to learn from different types of samples may help us acquire better filters in CNNs, improve the model generalization performance and potentially increase the interpretability of model behavior. We propose a novel yet simple framework called GaterNet, which involves a backbone and a gater network. The backbone network is a regular CNN that performs the major computation needed for making a prediction, while a global gater network is introduced to generate binary gates for selectively activating filters in the backbone network based on each input. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets show that our models consistently outperform the original models with a large margin.

Accordingly, several approaches have beenproposed recently to apply convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to omni-directional images for various visual tasks.However, most of them use image representations defined inthe Euclidean space after transforming the omni-directionalviews originally formed in the non-Euclidean space.  Thistransformation leads to shape distortion due to nonuniformspatial resolving power and the loss of continuity.   Theseeffects make existing convolution kernels experience diffi-culties in extracting meaningful information.     This paper presents a novel method to resolve such prob-lems  of  applying  CNNs  to  omni-directional  images.   Theproposed  method  utilizes  a  spherical  polyhedron  to  rep-resent omni-directional views.  This method minimizes thevariance of the spatial resolving power on the sphere sur-face,  and  includes  new  convolution  and  pooling  methodsfor the proposed representation.

In the later stages of training, we gradually reduce our assisted excitation to zero. We reached a new state-of-the-art in the speed-accuracy trade-off (Figure 1).

However, current state-of-the-art neural network models designed for graph learning, e.g., graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT), inadequately utilize edge features, especially multi-dimensional edge features. In this paper, we build a new framework for a family of new graph neural network models that can more sufficiently exploit edge features, including those of undirected or multi-dimensional edges. The proposed framework can consolidate current graph neural network models, e.g., GCN and GAT. The proposed framework and new models have the following novelties: First, we propose to use doubly stochastic normalization of graph edge features instead of the commonly used row or symmetric normalization approaches used in current graph neural networks. Second, we construct new formulas for the operations in each individual layer so that they can handle multi-dimensional edge features. Third, for the proposed new framework, edge features are adaptive across network layers. As a result, our proposed new framework and new models are able to exploit a rich source of graph edge information. We apply our new models to graph node classification on several citation networks, whole graph classification, and regression on several molecular datasets.

In this paper, we propose a new propagation mechanism called channel-wise addition (cAdd) to deal with the vanishing gradients problem without sacrificing the complexity of the learned features. Unlike channel-wise concatenation, cAdd is able to eliminate the need to store feature maps thus reducing the memory requirement. The proposed cAdd mechanism can deepen and widen existing neural architectures with fewer parameters compared to channel-wise concatenation and element-wise addition. We incorporate cAdd into state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNet, WideResNet, and CondenseNet and carry out extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN and ImageNet to demonstrate that cAdd-based architectures are able to achieve much higher accuracy with fewer parameters compared to their corresponding base architectures.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Propagation,Mechanism,for,Deep,and,Wide,Neural,Networks"

A framework for the study of such attacks is proposed, using real world object manipulations. Unlike most works in the past, this framework supports the design of attacks based on both small and large image perturbations, implemented by camera shake and pose variation. A setup is proposed for the collection of such perturbations and determination of their perceptibility. It is argued that perceptibility depends on context, and a distinction is made between imperceptible and semantically imperceptible perturbations. While the former survives image comparisons, the latter are perceptible but have no impact on human object recognition. A procedure is proposed to determine the perceptibility of perturbations using Turk experiments, and a dataset of both perturbation classes which enables replicable studies of object manipulation attacks, is assembled. Experiments using defenses based on many datasets, CNN models, and algorithms from the literature elucidate the difficulty of defending these attacks -- in fact, none of the existing defenses is found effective against them. Better results are achieved with real world data augmentation, but even this is not foolproof.

Existing solutions typically adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of samples and can be calculated by a simple formula (1-b^ n )/(1-b), where n is the number of samples and b \in [0,1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist. Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on long-tailed datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Class-Balanced,Loss,Based,on,Effective,Number,of,Samples"

This is harder than standard instance mining due to differences in the artistic media (oil, pastel, drawing, etc), and imperfections inherent in the copying process. Our key technical insight is to adapt a standard deep feature to this task by fine-tuning it on the specific art collection using self-supervised learning. More specifically, spatial consistency between neighbouring feature matches is used as supervisory fine-tuning signal. The adapted feature leads to more accurate style invariant matching, and can be used with a standard discovery approach, based on geometric verification, to identify duplicate patterns in the dataset. The approach is evaluated on several different datasets and shows surprisingly good qualitative discovery results. For quantitative evaluation of the method, we annotated 273 near duplicate details in a dataset of 1587 artworks attributed to Jan Brueghel and his workshop.

Furthermore,  we develop an end-to-end learning scheme that enables us to benefit from the proposed min-max strategy in training deep models.

How to leverage the information between co-occurrence and locations of objects for better reasoning? These questions are key challenges towards large-scale object detection system that aims to recognize thousands of objects entangled with complex spatial and semantic relationships nowadays.  Distilling key relations that may affect object recognition is crucially important since treating each region separately leads to a big performance drop when facing heavy long-tail data distributions and plenty of confusing categories. Recent works try to encode relation by constructing graphs, e.g. using handcraft linguistic knowledge between classes or implicitly learning a fully-connected graph between regions. However, the handcraft linguistic knowledge cannot be individualized for each image due to the semantic gap between linguistic and visual context while the fully-connected graph is inefficient and noisy by incorporating redundant and distracted relations/edges from irrelevant objects and backgrounds. In this work, we introduce a Spatial-aware Graph Relation Network (SGRN) to adaptive discover and incorporate key semantic and spatial relationships for reasoning over each object. Our method considers the relative location layouts and interactions among which can be easily injected into any detection pipelines to boost the performance. Specifically, our SGRN integrates a graph learner module for learning a interpatable sparse graph structure to encode relevant contextual regions and a spatial graph reasoning module with learnable spatial Gaussian kernels to perform graph inference with spatial awareness. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method, e.g. achieving around 32% improvement on VG(3000 classes) and 28% on ADE in terms of mAP.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spatial-Aware,Graph,Relation,Network,for,Large-Scale,Object,Detection"

Through an examination of its adaptive behavior, we observe that while the spatial support for its neural features conforms more closely than regular ConvNets to object structure, this support may nevertheless extend well beyond the region of interest, causing features to be influenced by irrelevant image content. To address this problem, we present a reformulation of Deformable ConvNets that improves its ability to focus on pertinent image regions, through increased modeling power and stronger training. The modeling power is enhanced through a more comprehensive integration of deformable convolution within the network, and by introducing a modulation mechanism that expands the scope of deformation modeling. To effectively harness this enriched modeling capability, we guide network training via a proposed feature mimicking scheme that helps the network to learn features that reflect the object focus and classification power of R-CNN features.

In this paper, we propose a novel network structure, Interaction-and-Aggregation (IA), to enhance the feature representation capability of CNNs. Firstly, Spatial IA (SIA) module is introduced. It models the interdependencies between spatial features and then aggregates the correlated features corresponding to the same body parts. Unlike CNNs which extract features from fixed rectangle regions, SIA can adaptively determine the receptive fields according to the input person pose and scale. Secondly, we introduce Channel IA (CIA) module which selectively aggregates channel features to enhance the feature representation, especially for small-scale visual cues. Further, IA network can be constructed by inserting IA blocks into CNNs at any depth. We validate the effectiveness of our model for person reID by demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Interaction-And-Aggregation,Network,for,Person,Re-Identification"
83,Rare Event Detection Using Disentangled Representation Learning,"This paper presents a novel method for rare event detection from an image pair with class-imbalanced datasets. A straightforward approach for event detection tasks is to train a detection network from a large-scale dataset in an end-to-end manner. However, in many applications such as building change detection on satellite images, few positive samples are available for the training. Moreover, an image pair of scenes contains many trivial events, such as in illumination changes or background motions. These many trivial events and the class imbalance problem lead to false alarms for rare event detection. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel method to learn disentangled representations from only low-cost negative samples. The proposed method disentangles the different aspects in a pair of observations: variant and invariant factors that represent trivial events and image contents, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the quantitative evaluations on four change detection datasets, and the qualitative analysis shows that the proposed method can acquire the representations that disentangle rare events from trivial ones.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Rare,Event,Detection,Using,Disentangled,Representation,Learning"
84,Shape Robust Text Detection With Progressive Scale Expansion Network,"Scene text detection has witnessed rapid progress especially with the recent development of convolutional neural networks. However, there still exists two challenges which prevent the algorithm into industry applications. On the one hand, most of the state-of-art algorithms require quadrangle bounding box which is in-accurate to locate the texts with arbitrary shape. On the other hand, two text instances which are close to each other may lead to a false detection which covers both instances. Traditionally, the segmentation-based approach can relieve the first problem but usually fail to solve the second challenge. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instances with arbitrary shapes. More specifically, PSENet generates the different scale of kernels for each text instance, and gradually expands the minimal scale kernel to the text instance with the complete shape. Due to the fact that there are large geometrical margins among the minimal scale kernels, our method is effective to split the close text instances, making it easier to use segmentation-based methods to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Extensive experiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate the effectiveness of PSENet. Notably, on CTW1500, a dataset full of long curve texts, PSENet achieves a F-measure of 74.3% at 27 FPS, and our best F-measure (82.2%) outperforms state-of-art algorithms by 6.6%. The code will be released in the future.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Shape,Robust,Text,Detection,With,Progressive,Scale,Expansion,Network"
85,Dual Encoding for Zero-Example Video Retrieval,"This paper attacks the challenging problem of zero-example video retrieval. In such a retrieval paradigm, an end user searches for unlabeled videos by ad-hoc queries described in natural language text with no visual example provided. Given videos as sequences of frames and queries as sequences of words, an effective sequence-to-sequence cross-modal matching is required. The majority of existing methods are concept based, extracting relevant concepts from queries and videos and accordingly establishing associations between the two modalities. In contrast, this paper takes a concept-free approach, proposing a dual deep encoding network that encodes videos and queries into powerful dense representations of their own. Dual encoding is conceptually simple, practically effective and end-to-end. As experiments on three benchmarks, i.e. MSR-VTT, TRECVID 2016 and 2017 Ad-hoc Video Search show, the proposed solution establishes a new state-of-the-art for zero-example video retrieval.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dual,Encoding,for,Zero-Example,Video,Retrieval"
86,MaxpoolNMS: Getting Rid of NMS Bottlenecks in Two-Stage Object Detectors,"Modern convolutional object detectors have improved the detection accuracy significantly, which in turn inspired the development of dedicated hardware accelerators to achieve real-time performance by exploiting inherent parallelism in the algorithm. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is an indispensable operation in object detection. In stark contrast to most operations, the commonly-adopted GreedyNMS algorithm does not foster parallelism, which can be a major performance bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce MaxpoolNMS, a parallelizable alternative to the NMS algorithm, which is based on max-pooling classification score maps. By employing a novel multi-scale multi-channel max-pooling strategy, our method is 20x faster than GreedyNMS while simultaneously achieves comparable accuracy, when quantified across various benchmarking datasets, i.e., MS COCO, KITTI and PASCAL VOC. Furthermore, our method is better suited for hardware-based acceleration than GreedyNMS.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MaxpoolNMS:,Getting,Rid,of,NMS,Bottlenecks,in,Two-Stage,Object,Detectors"
87,Character Region Awareness for Text Detection,"Scene text detection methods based on neural networks have emerged recently and have shown promising results. Previous methods trained with rigid word-level bounding boxes exhibit limitations in representing the text region in an arbitrary shape. In this paper, we propose a new scene text detection method to effectively detect text area by exploring each character and affinity between characters. To overcome the lack of individual character level annotations, our proposed framework exploits both the given character-level annotations for synthetic images and the estimated character-level ground-truths for real images acquired by the learned interim model. In order to estimate affinity between characters, the network is trained with the newly proposed representation for affinity. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including the TotalText and CTW-1500 datasets which contain highly curved texts in natural images, demonstrate that our character-level text detection significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors. According to the results, our proposed method guarantees high flexibility in detecting complicated scene text images, such as arbitrarily-oriented, curved, or deformed texts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Character,Region,Awareness,for,Text,Detection"
88,Effective Aesthetics Prediction With Multi-Level Spatially Pooled Features,"We propose an effective deep learning approach to aesthetics quality assessment that relies on a new type of pre-trained features, and apply it to the AVA data set, the currently largest aesthetics database. While previous approaches miss some of the information in the original images, due to taking small crops, down-scaling or warping the originals during training, we propose the first method that efficiently supports full resolution images as an input, and can be trained on variable input sizes. This allows us to significantly improve upon the state of the art, increasing the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC) of ground-truth mean opinion scores (MOS) from the existing best reported of 0.612 to 0.756. To achieve this performance, we extract multi-level spatially pooled (MLSP) features from all convolutional blocks of a pre-trained InceptionResNet-v2 network, and train a custom shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture on these new features.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Effective,Aesthetics,Prediction,With,Multi-Level,Spatially,Pooled,Features"
89,Attentive Region Embedding Network for Zero-Shot Learning,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify images from unseen categories, by merely utilizing seen class images as the training data. Existing works on ZSL mainly leverage the global features or learn the global regions, from which, to construct the embeddings to the semantic space. However, few of them study the discrimination power implied in local image regions (parts), which, in some sense, correspond to semantic attributes, have stronger discrimination than attributes, and can thus assist the semantic transfer between seen/unseen classes. In this paper, to discover (semantic) regions, we propose the attentive region embedding network (AREN), which is tailored to advance the ZSL task. Specifically, AREN is end-to-end trainable and consists of two network branches, i.e., the attentive region embedding (ARE) stream, and the attentive compressed second-order embedding (ACSE) stream. ARE is capable of discovering multiple part regions under the guidance of the attention and the compatibility loss. Moreover, a novel adaptive thresholding mechanism is proposed for suppressing redundant (such as background) attention regions. To further guarantee more stable semantic transfer from the perspective of second-order collaboration, ACSE is incorporated into the AREN. In the comprehensive evaluations on four benchmarks, our models achieve state-of-the-art performances under ZSL setting, and compelling results under generalized ZSL setting.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attentive,Region,Embedding,Network,for,Zero-Shot,Learning"
90,Explicit Spatial Encoding for Deep Local Descriptors,"We propose a kernelized deep local-patch descriptor based on efficient match kernels of neural network activations. Response of each receptive field is encoded together with its spatial location using explicit feature maps. Two location parametrizations, Cartesian and polar, are used to provide robustness to a different types of canonical patch misalignment. Additionally, we analyze how the conventional architecture, i.e. a fully connected layer attached after the convolutional part, encodes responses in a spatially variant way. In contrary, explicit spatial encoding is used in our descriptor, whose potential applications are not limited to local-patches. We evaluate the descriptor on standard benchmarks. Both versions, encoding 32x32 or 64x64 patches, consistently outperform all other methods on all benchmarks. The number  of parameters of the model is independent of the input patch resolution.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Explicit,Spatial,Encoding,for,Deep,Local,Descriptors"
91,Panoptic Segmentation,"We propose and study a task we name panoptic segmentation (PS). Panoptic segmentation unifies the typically distinct tasks of semantic segmentation (assign a class label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detect and segment each object instance). The proposed task requires generating a coherent scene segmentation that is rich and complete, an important step toward real-world vision systems. While early work in computer vision addressed related image/scene parsing tasks, these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or associated recognition challenges. To address this, we propose a novel panoptic quality (PQ) metric that captures performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner. Using the proposed metric, we perform a rigorous study of both human and machine performance for PS on three existing datasets, revealing interesting insights about the task. The aim of our work is to revive the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation.

92,You Reap What You Sow: Using Videos to Generate High Precision Object Proposals for Weakly-Supervised Object Detection,"We propose a novel way of using videos to obtain high precision object proposals for weakly-supervised object detection.  Existing weakly-supervised detection approaches use off-the-shelf proposal methods like edge boxes or selective search to obtain candidate boxes. These methods provide high recall but at the expense of thousands of noisy proposals. Thus, the entire burden of finding the few relevant object regions is left to the ensuing object mining step. To mitigate this issue, we focus instead on improving the precision of the initial candidate object proposals. Since we cannot rely on localization annotations, we turn to video and leverage motion cues to automatically estimate the extent of objects to train a Weakly-supervised Region Proposal Network (W-RPN). We use the W-RPN to generate high precision object proposals, which are in turn used to re-rank high recall proposals like edge boxes or selective search according to their spatial overlap.  Our W-RPN proposals lead to significant improvement in performance for state-of-the-art weakly-supervised object detection approaches on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"You,Reap,What,You,Sow:,Using,Videos,to,Generate,High,Precision,Object,Proposals,for,Weakly-Supervised,Object,Detection"
93,Explore-Exploit Graph Traversal for Image Retrieval,"We propose a novel graph-based approach for image retrieval. Given a nearest neighbor graph produced by the global descriptor model, we traverse it by alternating between exploit and explore steps. The exploit step maximally utilizes the immediate neighborhood of each vertex, while the explore step traverses vertices that are farther away in the descriptor space. By combining these two steps we can better capture the underlying image manifold, and successfully retrieve relevant images that are visually dissimilar to the query. Our traversal algorithm is conceptually simple, has few tunable parameters and can be implemented with basic data structures. This enables fast real-time inference for previously unseen queries with minimal memory overhead. Despite relative simplicity, we show highly competitive results on multiple public benchmarks, including the largest image retrieval dataset that is currently publicly available.

94,Dissimilarity Coefficient Based Weakly Supervised Object Detection,"We consider the problem of weakly supervised object detection, where the training samples are annotated using only image-level labels that indicate the presence or absence of an object category. In order to model the uncertainty in the location of the objects, we employ a dissimilarity coefficient based probabilistic learning objective. The learning objective minimizes the difference between an annotation agnostic prediction distribution and an annotation aware conditional distribution. The main computational challenge is the complex nature of the conditional distribution, which consists of terms over hundreds or thousands of variables. The complexity of the conditional distribution rules out the possibility of explicitly modeling it. Instead, we exploit the fact that deep learning frameworks rely on stochastic optimization. This allows us to use a state of the art discrete generative model that can provide annotation consistent samples from the conditional distribution. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dissimilarity,Coefficient,Based,Weakly,Supervised,Object,Detection"
95,Kernel Transformer Networks for Compact Spherical Convolution,"Ideally, 360deg imagery could inherit the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) already trained with great success on perspective projection images. However, existing methods to transfer CNNs from perspective to spherical images introduce significant computational costs and/or degradations in accuracy. We present the Kernel Transformer Network (KTN) to efficiently transfer convolution kernels from perspective images to the equirectangular projection of 360deg images. Given a source CNN for perspective images as input, the KTN produces a function parameterized by a polar angle and kernel as output. Given a novel 360deg image, that function in turn can compute convolutions for arbitrary layers and kernels as would the source CNN on the corresponding tangent plane projections. Distinct from all existing methods, KTNs allow model transfer: the same model can be applied to different source CNNs with the same base architecture. This enables application to multiple recognition tasks without re-training the KTN. Validating our approach with multiple source CNNs and datasets, we show that KTNs improve the state of the art for spherical convolution. KTNs successfully preserve the source CNN's accuracy, while offering transferability, scalability to typical image resolutions, and, in many cases, a substantially lower memory footprint.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Kernel,Transformer,Networks,for,Compact,Spherical,Convolution"
96,Object Detection With Location-Aware Deformable Convolution and Backward Attention Filtering,"Multi-class and multi-scale object detection for autonomous driving is challenging because of the high variation in object scales and the cluttered background in complex street scenes. Context information and high-resolution features are the keys to achieve a good performance in multi-scale object detection. However, context information is typically unevenly distributed, and the high-resolution feature map also contains distractive low-level features. In this paper, we propose a location-aware deformable convolution and a backward attention filtering to improve the detection performance. The location-aware deformable convolution extracts the unevenly distributed context features by sampling the input from where informative context exists. Different from the original deformable convolution, the proposed method applies an individual convolutional layer on each input sampling grid location to obtain a wide and unique receptive field for a better offset estimation. Meanwhile, the backward attention filtering module filters the high-resolution feature map by highlighting the informative features and suppressing the distractive features using the semantic features from the deep layers. Extensive experiments are conducted on the KITTI object detection and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets. The proposed method shows an average 6% performance improvement over the Faster R-CNN baseline, and it has the top-3 performance on the KITTI leaderboard with the fastest processing speed.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Object,Detection,With,Location-Aware,Deformable,Convolution,and,Backward,Attention,Filtering"

We tackle an open-set graphic symbol recognition problem by one-shot classification with prototypical images as a single training example for each novel class. We take an approach to learn a generalizable embedding space for novel tasks. We propose a new approach called variational prototyping-encoder (VPE) that learns the image translation task from real-world input images to their corresponding prototypical images as a meta-task. As a result, VPE learns image similarity as well as prototypical concepts which differs from widely used metric learning based approaches. Our experiments with diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed VPE performs favorably against competing metric learning based one-shot methods. Also, our qualitative analyses show that our meta-task induces an effective embedding space suitable for unseen data representation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Variational,Prototyping-Encoder:,One-Shot,Learning,With,Prototypical,Images"

Specifically, we propose domain alignment layers which implement feature whitening for the purpose of matching source and target feature distributions. Additionally, we leverage the unlabeled target data by proposing the Min-Entropy Consensus loss, which  regularizes  training while avoiding the adoption of many user-defined hyper-parameters. We report results on publicly available datasets, considering both digit classification and object recognition tasks. We show that, in most of our experiments, our approach improves upon previous methods, setting new state-of-the-art performances.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Domain,Adaptation,Using,Feature-Whitening,and,Consensus,Loss"
99,FEELVOS: Fast End-To-End Embedding Learning for Video Object Segmentation,"Many of the recent successful methods for video object segmentation (VOS) are overly complicated, heavily rely on fine-tuning on the first frame, and/or are slow, and are hence of limited practical use. In this work, we propose FEELVOS as a simple and fast method which does not rely on fine-tuning. In order to segment a video, for each frame FEELVOS uses a semantic pixel-wise embedding together with a global and a local matching mechanism to transfer information from the first frame and from the previous frame of the video to the current frame. In contrast to previous work, our embedding is only used as an internal guidance of a convolutional network. Our novel dynamic segmentation head allows us to train the network, including the embedding, end-to-end for the multiple object segmentation task with a cross entropy loss. We achieve a new state of the art in video object segmentation without fine-tuning with a J&F measure of 71.5% on the DAVIS 2017 validation set.

100,PartNet: A Recursive Part Decomposition Network for Fine-Grained and Hierarchical Shape Segmentation,"Deep learning approaches to 3D shape segmentation are typically formulated as a multi-class labeling problem. These models are trained for a fixed set of labels, which greatly limits their flexibility and adaptivity. We opt for top-down recursive decomposition and develop the first deep learning model for hierarchical segmentation of 3D shapes, based on recursive neural networks. Starting from a full shape represented as a point cloud, our model performs recursive binary decomposition, where the decomposition network at all nodes in the hierarchy share weights. At each node, a node classifier is trained to determine the type (adjacency or symmetry) and stopping criteria of its decomposition. The features extracted in higher level nodes are recursively propagated to lower level ones. Thus, the meaningful decompositions in higher levels provide strong contextual cues constraining the segmentations in lower levels. Meanwhile, to increase the segmentation accuracy at each node, we enhance the recursive contextual feature with the shape feature extracted for the corresponding part. Our method segments a 3D shape in point cloud into an arbitrary number of parts, depending on the shape complexity, showing strong generality and flexibility. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance, both for fine-grained and semantic segmentation, on the public benchmark and a new benchmark of fine-grained segmentation proposed in this work. We also demonstrate its application for fine-grained part refinements in image-to-shape reconstruction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PartNet:,A,Recursive,Part,Decomposition,Network,for,Fine-Grained,and,Hierarchical,Shape,Segmentation"
101,Learning Multi-Class Segmentations From Single-Class Datasets,"Multi-class segmentation has recently achieved significant performance in natural images and videos. This achievement is due primarily to the public availability of large multi-class datasets. However, there are certain domains, such as biomedical images, where obtaining sufficient multi-class annotations is a laborious and often impossible task and only single-class datasets are available. While existing segmentation research in such domains use private multi-class datasets or focus on single-class segmentations, we propose a unified highly efficient framework for robust simultaneous learning of multi-class segmentations by combining single-class datasets and utilizing a novel way of conditioning a convolutional network for the purpose of segmentation. We demonstrate various ways of incorporating the conditional information, perform an extensive evaluation, and show compelling multi-class segmentation performance on biomedical images, which outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions (up to 2.7%). Unlike current solutions, which are meticulously tailored for particular single-class datasets, we utilize datasets from a variety of sources.

We describe how these 2D-2D matches can be generated with little human interaction by geometrically matching points from 3D models built from images. Two cross-season correspondence datasets are created providing 2D-2D matches across seasonal changes as well as from day to night.

After a decade of active research, zero-shot learning (ZSL) models accuracy on the Imagenet benchmark remains far too low to be considered for practical object recognition applications. In this paper, we argue that the main reason behind this apparent lack of progress is the poor quality of this benchmark. We highlight major structural flaws of the current benchmark and analyze different factors impacting the accuracy of ZSL models. We show that the actual classification accuracy of existing ZSL models is significantly higher than was previously thought as we account for these flaws. We then introduce the notion of structural bias specific to ZSL datasets. We discuss how the presence of this new form of bias allows for a trivial solution to the standard benchmark and conclude on the need for a new benchmark.

This problem is referred to as ""representation bias"". The question of how to reduce the representation biases of a dataset is investigated and a new dataset REPresentAtion bIas Removal (REPAIR) procedure is proposed. This formulates bias minimization as an optimization problem, seeking a weight distribution that penalizes examples easy for a classifier built on a given feature representation. Bias reduction is then equated to maximizing the ratio between the classification loss on the reweighted dataset and the uncertainty of the ground-truth class labels. This is a minimax problem that REPAIR solves by alternatingly updating classifier parameters and dataset resampling weights, using stochastic gradient descent. An experimental set-up is also introduced to measure the bias of any dataset for a given representation, and the impact of this bias on the performance of recognition models. Experiments with synthetic and action recognition data show that dataset REPAIR can significantly reduce representation bias, and lead to improved generalization of models trained on REPAIRed datasets.

109,Label Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning via Graph Filtering,"Graph-based methods have been demonstrated as one of the most effective approaches for semi-supervised learning, as they can exploit the connectivity patterns between labeled and unlabeled data samples to improve learning performance. However, existing graph-based methods either are limited in their ability to jointly model graph structures and data features, such as the classical label propagation methods, or require a considerable amount of labeled data for training and validation due to high model complexity, such as the recent neural-network-based methods. In this paper, we address label efficient semi-supervised learning from a graph filtering perspective. Specifically, we propose a graph filtering framework that injects graph similarity into data features by taking them as signals on the graph and applying a low-pass graph filter to extract useful data representations for classification, where label efficiency can be achieved by conveniently adjusting the strength of the graph filter. Interestingly, this framework unifies two seemingly very different methods -- label propagation and graph convolutional networks. Revisiting them under the graph filtering framework leads to new insights that improve their modeling capabilities and reduce model complexity.

In addition, we provide pixel-precise ground truth regions for all anomalies. We also conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods based on deep architectures such as convolutional autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and feature descriptors using pre-trained convolutional neural networks, as well as classical computer vision methods. This initial benchmark indicates that there is considerable room for improvement.

Each model is a collection of explicitly parametrized curves and surfaces, providing ground truth for differential quantities, patch segmentation, geometric feature detection, and shape reconstruction. Sampling the parametric descriptions of surfaces and curves allows generating data in different formats and resolutions, enabling fair comparisons for a wide range of geometric learning algorithms. As a use case for our dataset, we perform a large-scale benchmark for estimation of surface normals, comparing existing data driven methods and evaluating their performance against both the ground truth and traditional normal estimation methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ABC:,A,Big,CAD,Model,Dataset,for,Geometric,Deep,Learning"
112,Tightness-Aware Evaluation Protocol for Scene Text Detection,"Evaluation protocols play key role in the developmental progress of text detection methods. There are strict requirements to ensure that the evaluation methods are fair, objective and reasonable. However, existing metrics exhibit some obvious drawbacks: 1) They are not goal-oriented; 2) they cannot recognize the tightness of detection methods; 3) existing one-to-many and many-to-one solutions involve inherent loopholes and deficiencies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel evaluation protocol called Tightness-aware Intersect-over-Union (TIoU) metric that could quantify completeness of ground truth, compactness of detection, and tightness of matching degree. Specifically, instead of merely using the IoU value, two common detection behaviors are properly considered; meanwhile, directly using the score of TIoU to recognize the tightness. In addition, we further propose a straightforward method to address the annotation granularity issue, which can fairly evaluate word and text-line detections simultaneously. By adopting the detection results from published methods and general object detection frameworks, comprehensive experiments on ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015 datasets are conducted to compare recent metrics and the proposed TIoU metric. The comparison demonstrated some promising new prospects, e.g., determining the methods and frameworks for which the detection is tighter and more beneficial to recognize. Our method is extremely simple; however, the novelty is none other than the proposed metric can utilize simplest but reasonable improvements to lead to many interesting and insightful prospects and solving most the issues of the previous metrics.

113,PointConv: Deep Convolutional Networks on 3D Point Clouds,"Unlike images which are represented in regular dense grids, 3D point clouds are irregular and unordered, hence applying convolution on them can be difficult. In this paper, we extend the dynamic filter to a new convolution operation, named PointConv. PointConv can be applied on point clouds to build deep convolutional networks. We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear functions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density functions. With respect to a given point, the weight functions are learned with multi-layer perceptron networks and the density functions through kernel density estimation. A novel reformulation is proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions, which allowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its performance. The learned convolution kernel can be used to compute translation-invariant and permutation-invariant convolution on any point set in the 3D space. Besides, PointConv can also be used as deconvolution operators to propagate features from a subsampled point cloud back to its original resolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanNet show that deep convolutional neural networks built on PointConv are able to achieve state-of-the-art on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks on 3D point clouds. Besides, our experiments converting CIFAR-10 into a point cloud showed that networks built on PointConv can match the performance of convolutional networks in 2D images of a similar structure.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PointConv:,Deep,Convolutional,Networks,on,3D,Point,Clouds"
114,Octree Guided CNN With Spherical Kernels for 3D Point Clouds,"We propose an octree guided neural network architecture and  spherical  convolutional  kernel  for  machine  learning from arbitrary 3D point clouds.  The network  architecture capitalizes on the sparse nature of irregular point clouds,and  hierarchically  coarsens  the  data  representation  with space partitioning.  At the same time, the proposed spherical kernels systematically quantize point neighborhoods to identify local geometric structures in the data, while maintaining the properties of translation-invariance and asymmetry. We specify spherical kernels with the help of network neurons that in turn are associated with spatial locations.We exploit this association to avert dynamic kernel generation during network training that enables efficient learning with high resolution point clouds.  The effectiveness of the proposed technique is established on the benchmark tasks of 3D object classification and segmentation, achieving competitive performance on ShapeNet and RueMonge2014 datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Octree,Guided,CNN,With,Spherical,Kernels,for,3D,Point,Clouds"
115,VITAMIN-E: VIsual Tracking and MappINg With Extremely Dense Feature Points,"In this paper, we propose a novel indirect monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm called ""VITAMIN-E,"" which is highly accurate and robust as a result of tracking extremely dense feature points. Typical indirect methods have difficulty in reconstructing dense geometry because of their careful feature point selection for accurate matching. Unlike conventional methods, the proposed method processes an enormous number of feature points using the tracking local extrema of curvature based on dominant flow estimation. Because this may lead to high computational cost during bundle adjustment, we propose a novel optimization technique called the ""subspace Newton's method"" that significantly improves the computational efficiency of bundle adjustment by partially updating the variables. We concurrently generate meshes from the reconstructed points and merge them for an entire three-dimensional(3D) model. Experimental results on the SLAM benchmark EuRoC demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art SLAM methods such as DSO, ORB-SLAM, and LSD-SLAM, both in terms of accuracy and robustness in trajectory estimation. The proposed method simultaneously generated significantly detailed 3D geometry as a result of the dense feature points in real time using only a CPU.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"VITAMIN-E:,VIsual,Tracking,and,MappINg,With,Extremely,Dense,Feature,Points"
116,Conditional Single-View Shape Generation for Multi-View Stereo Reconstruction,"In this paper, we present a new perspective towards image-based shape generation. Most existing deep learning based shape reconstruction methods employ a single-view deterministic model which is sometimes insufficient to determine a single groundtruth shape because the back part is occluded. In this work, we first introduce a conditional generative network to model the uncertainty for single-view reconstruction. Then, we formulate the task of multi-view reconstruction as taking the intersection of the predicted shape spaces on each single image. We design new differentiable guidance including the front constraint, the diversity constraint, and the consistency loss to enable effective single-view conditional generation and multi-view synthesis. Experimental results and ablation studies show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3D reconstruction test error and demonstrates its generalization ability on real world data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Conditional,Single-View,Shape,Generation,for,Multi-View,Stereo,Reconstruction"
117,Learning to Adapt for Stereo,"Real world applications of stereo depth estimation require models that are robust to dynamic variations in the environment. Even though deep learning based stereo methods are successful, they often fail to generalize to unseen variations in the environment, making them less suitable for practical applications such as autonomous driving. In this work, we introduce a ""learning-to-adapt"" framework that enables deep stereo methods to continuously adapt to new target domains in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, our approach incorporates the adaptation procedure into the learning objective to obtain a base set of parameters that are better suited for unsupervised online adaptation. To further improve the quality of the adaptation, we learn a confidence measure that effectively masks the errors introduced during the unsupervised adaptation. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real-world stereo datasets and our experiments evidence that learning-to-adapt is, indeed beneficial for online adaptation on vastly different domains.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Adapt,for,Stereo"
118,3D Appearance Super-Resolution With Deep Learning,"We tackle the problem of retrieving high-resolution (HR) texture maps of objects that are captured from multiple view points. In the multi-view case, model-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been recently proved to recover high quality texture maps.  On the other hand, the advent of deep learning-based methods has already a significant impact on the problem of video and image SR. Yet, a deep learning-based approach to super-resolve the appearance of 3D objects is still missing. The main limitation of exploiting the power of deep learning techniques in the multi-view case is the lack of data. We introduce a 3D appearance SR (3DASR) dataset based on the existing ETH3D [42], SyB3R [31], MiddleBury, and our Collection of 3D scenes from TUM [21], Fountain [51] and Relief [53]. We provide the high- and low-resolution texture maps, the 3D geometric model, images and projection matrices. We exploit the power of 2D learning-based SR methods and design networks suitable for the 3D multi-view case. We incorporate the geometric information by introducing normal maps and further improve the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed networks successfully incorporate the 3D geometric information and super-resolve the texture maps.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"3D,Appearance,Super-Resolution,With,Deep,Learning"
119,Radial Distortion Triangulation,"This paper presents the first optimal, maximal likelihood, solution to the triangulation problem for radially distorted cameras. The proposed solution to the two-view triangulation problem minimizes the L2-norm of the reprojection error in the distorted image space. We cast the problem as the search for corrected distorted image points, and we use a Lagrange multiplier formulation to impose the epipolar constraint for undistorted points. For the one-parameter division model, this formulation leads to a system of five quartic polynomial equations in five unknowns, which can be exactly solved using the Groebner basis method. While the proposed Groebner basis solution is provably optimal; it is too slow for practical applications. Therefore, we developed a fast iterative solver to this problem. Extensive empirical tests show that the iterative algorithm delivers the optimal solution virtually every time, thus making it an L2-optimal algorithm de facto. It is iterative in nature, yet in practice, it converges in no more than five iterations. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world data, and we show the benefits of performing the triangulation in the distorted space in the presence of radial distortion.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Radial,Distortion,Triangulation"
120,Robust Point Cloud Based Reconstruction of Large-Scale Outdoor Scenes,"Outlier feature matches and loop-closures that survived front-end data association can lead to catastrophic failures in the back-end optimization of large-scale point cloud based 3D reconstruction. To alleviate this problem, we propose a probabilistic approach for robust back-end optimization in the presence of outliers. More specifically, we model the problem as a Bayesian network and solve it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Our approach leverages on a long-tail Cauchy distribution to suppress outlier feature matches in the odometry constraints, and a Cauchy-Uniform mixture model with a set of binary latent variables to simultaneously suppress outlier loop-closure constraints and outlier feature matches in the inlier loop-closure constraints. Furthermore, we show that by using a Gaussian-Uniform mixture model, our approach degenerates to the formulation of a state-of-the-art approach for robust indoor reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has comparable performance with the state-of-the-art on a benchmark indoor dataset, and outperforms it on a large-scale outdoor dataset.

121,Minimal Solvers for Mini-Loop Closures in 3D Multi-Scan Alignment,"3D scan registration is a classical, yet a highly useful problem in the context of 3D sensors such as Kinect and Velodyne. While there are several existing methods, the techniques are usually incremental where adjacent scans are registered first to obtain the initial poses, followed by motion averaging and bundle-adjustment refinement. In this paper, we take a different approach and develop minimal solvers for jointly computing the initial poses of cameras in small loops such as 3-, 4-, and 5-cycles. Note that the classical registration of 2 scans can be done using a minimum of 3 point matches to compute 6 degrees of relative motion. On the other hand, to jointly compute the 3D registrations in n-cycles, we take 2 point matches between the first n-1 consecutive pairs (i.e., Scan 1 & Scan 2, ... , and Scan n-1 & Scan n) and 1 or 2 point matches between Scan 1 and Scan n. Overall, we use 5, 7, and 10 point matches for 3-, 4-, and 5-cycles, and recover 12, 18, and 24 degrees of transformation variables, respectively. Using simulations and real-data we show that the 3D registration using mini n-cycles are computationally efficient, and can provide alternate and better initial poses compared to standard pairwise methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Minimal,Solvers,for,Mini-Loop,Closures,in,3D,Multi-Scan,Alignment"
122,Volumetric Capture of Humans With a Single RGBD Camera via Semi-Parametric Learning,"Volumetric (4D) performance capture is fundamental for AR/VR content generation. Whereas previous work in 4D performance capture has shown impressive results in studio settings, the technology is still far from being accessible to a typical consumer who, at best, might own a single RGBD sensor. Thus, in this work, we propose a method to synthesize free viewpoint renderings using a single RGBD camera. The key insight is to leverage previously seen ""calibration"" images of a given user to extrapolate what should be rendered in a novel viewpoint from the data available in the sensor. Given these past observations from multiple viewpoints, and the current RGBD image from a fixed view, we propose an end-to-end framework that fuses both these data sources to generate novel renderings of the performer. We demonstrate that the method can produce high fidelity images, and handle extreme changes in subject pose and camera viewpoints. We also show that the system generalizes to performers not seen in the training data. We run exhaustive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed semi-parametric model (i.e. calibration images available to the neural network) compared to other state of the art machine learned solutions. Further, we compare the method with more traditional pipelines that employ multi-view capture. We show that our framework is able to achieve compelling results, with substantially less infrastructure than previously required.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Volumetric,Capture,of,Humans,With,a,Single,RGBD,Camera,via,Semi-Parametric,Learning"
123,Joint Face Detection and Facial Motion Retargeting for Multiple Faces,"Facial motion retargeting is an important problem in both computer graphics and vision, which involves capturing the performance of a human face and transferring it to another 3D character. Learning 3D morphable model (3DMM) parameters from 2D face images using convolutional neural networks is common in 2D face alignment, 3D face reconstruction etc. However, existing methods either require an additional face detection step before retargeting or use a cascade of separate networks to perform detection followed by retargeting in a sequence. In this paper, we present a single end-to-end network to jointly predict the bounding box locations and 3DMM parameters for multiple faces. First, we design a novel multitask learning framework that learns a disentangled representation of 3DMM parameters for a single face. Then, we leverage the trained single face model to generate ground truth 3DMM parameters for multiple faces to train another network that performs joint face detection and motion retargeting for images with multiple faces. Experimental results show that our joint detection and retargeting network has high face detection accuracy and is robust to extreme expressions and poses while being faster than state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Joint,Face,Detection,and,Facial,Motion,Retargeting,for,Multiple,Faces"

Second, we restore relative depth maps from selectively estimated data based on the rank-1 property of pairwise comparison matrices. Third, we decompose ordinary and relative depth maps into components and recombine them optimally to reconstruct a final depth map.

As a result, existing algorithms experience difficulties in accurate generative modeling of 3D shapes. Here, we propose a novel factorized generative model for 3D shape generation that sequentially transitions from coarse to fine scale shape generation. To this end, we introduce an unsupervised primitive discovery algorithm based on a higher-order conditional random field model. Using the primitive parts for shapes as attributes, a parameterized 3D representation is modeled in the first stage. This representation is further refined  in the next stage by adding fine scale details to shape. Our results demonstrate improved representation ability of the generative model and better quality samples of newly generated 3D shapes. Further, our primitive generation approach can accurately parse common objects into a simplified representation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Primitive,Discovery,for,Improved,3D,Generative,Modeling"
126,Learning to Explore Intrinsic Saliency for Stereoscopic Video,"The human visual system excels at biasing the stereoscopic visual signals by the attention mechanisms. Traditional methods relying on the low-level features and depth relevant information for stereoscopic video saliency prediction have fundamental limitations. For example, it is cumbersome to model the interactions between multiple visual cues including spatial, temporal, and depth  information as a result of the sophistication. In this paper, we argue that the high-level features are crucial and resort to the deep learning framework to learn the saliency map of stereoscopic videos. Driven by spatio-temporal coherence from consecutive frames, the model first imitates the mechanism of saliency by taking advantage of the 3D convolutional neural network. Subsequently, the saliency originated from the intrinsic depth is derived based on the correlations between left and right views in a data-driven manner. Finally, a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) based fusion network is developed to model the instantaneous interactions between spatio-temporal and depth attributes, such that the ultimate stereoscopic saliency maps over time are produced. Moreover, we establish a new large-scale stereoscopic video saliency dataset (SVS) including 175 stereoscopic video sequences and their fixation density annotations, aiming to comprehensively study the intrinsic attributes for stereoscopic video saliency detection. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model can achieve superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods on the newly built dataset for stereoscopic videos.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Explore,Intrinsic,Saliency,for,Stereoscopic,Video"
127,"Spherical Regression: Learning Viewpoints, Surface Normals and 3D Rotations on N-Spheres","Many computer vision challenges require continuous outputs, but tend to be solved by discrete classification. The reason is classification's natural containment within a probability n-simplex, as defined by the popular softmax activation function. Regular regression lacks such a closed geometry, leading to unstable training and convergence to suboptimal local minima. Starting from this insight we revisit regression in convolutional neural networks. We observe many continuous output problems in computer vision are naturally contained in closed geometrical manifolds, like the Euler angles in viewpoint estimation or the normals in surface normal estimation. A natural framework for posing such continuous output problems are n-spheres, which are naturally closed geometric manifolds defined in the R^(n+1) space. By introducing a spherical exponential mapping on n-spheres at the regression output, we obtain well-behaved gradients, leading to stable training. We show how our spherical regression can be utilized for several computer vision challenges, specifically viewpoint estimation, surface normal estimation and 3D rotation estimation. For all these problems our experiments demonstrate the benefit of spherical regression.

128,Refine and Distill: Exploiting Cycle-Inconsistency and Knowledge Distillation for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation,"Nowadays, the majority of state of the art monocular depth estimation techniques are based on supervised deep learning models. However, collecting RGB images with associated depth maps is a very time consuming procedure. Therefore, recent works have proposed deep architectures for addressing the monocular depth prediction task as a reconstruction problem, thus avoiding the need of collecting ground-truth depth. Following these works, we propose a novel self-supervised deep model for estimating depth maps. Our framework exploits two main strategies: refinement via cycle-inconsistency and distillation. Specifically, first a student network is trained to predict a disparity map such as to recover from a frame in a camera view the associated image in the opposite view. Then, a backward cycle network is applied to the generated image to re-synthesize back the input image, estimating the opposite disparity. A third network exploits the inconsistency between the original and the reconstructed input frame in order to output a refined depth map. Finally, knowledge distillation is exploited, such as to transfer information from the refinement network to the student. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework which outperforms state of the art unsupervised methods on the KITTI benchmark.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Refine,and,Distill:,Exploiting,Cycle-Inconsistency,and,Knowledge,Distillation,for,Unsupervised,Monocular,Depth,Estimation"

Because of this ambiguity, although a 3D object reconstructor can be trained using a single view or a few views per object, reconstructed shapes only fit the observed views and appear incorrect from the unobserved viewpoints. To reconstruct shapes that look reasonable from any viewpoint, we propose to train a discriminator that learns prior knowledge regarding possible views. The discriminator is trained to distinguish the reconstructed views of the observed viewpoints from those of the unobserved viewpoints. The reconstructor is trained to correct unobserved views by fooling the discriminator. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and natural image datasets; this validates the effectiveness of our method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,View,Priors,for,Single-View,3D,Reconstruction"
130,Geometry-Aware Symmetric Domain Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation,"Supervised depth estimation has achieved high accuracy due to the advanced deep network architectures. Since the groundtruth depth labels are hard to obtain, recent methods try to learn depth estimation networks in an unsupervised way by exploring unsupervised cues, which are effective but less reliable than true labels. An emerging way to resolve this dilemma is to transfer knowledge from synthetic images with ground truth depth via domain adaptation techniques. However, these approaches overlook specific geometric structure of the natural images in the target domain (i.e., real data), which is important for high-performing depth prediction. Motivated by the observation, we propose a geometry-aware symmetric domain adaptation framework (GASDA) to explore the labels in the synthetic data and epipolar geometry in the real data jointly. Moreover, by training two image style translators and depth estimators symmetrically in an end-to-end network, our model achieves better image style transfer and generates high-quality depth maps.

131,Learning Monocular Depth Estimation Infusing Traditional Stereo Knowledge,"Depth estimation from a single image represents a fascinating, yet challenging problem with countless applications. Recent works proved that this task could be learned without direct supervision from ground truth labels leveraging image synthesis on sequences or stereo pairs. Focusing on this second case, in this paper we leverage stereo matching in order to improve monocular depth estimation. To this aim we propose monoResMatch, a novel deep architecture designed to infer depth from a single input image by synthesizing features from a different point of view, horizontally aligned with the input image, performing stereo matching between the two cues. In contrast to previous works sharing this rationale, our network is the first trained end-to-end from scratch. Moreover, we show how obtaining proxy ground truth annotation through traditional stereo algorithms, such as Semi-Global Matching, enables more accurate monocular depth estimation still countering the need for expensive depth labels by keeping a self-supervised approach. Exhaustive experimental results prove how the synergy between i) the proposed monoResMatch architecture and ii) proxy-supervision attains state-of-the-art for self-supervised monocular depth estimation.

132,SIGNet: Semantic Instance Aided Unsupervised 3D Geometry Perception,"Unsupervised learning for geometric perception (depth, optical flow, etc.) is of great interest to autonomous systems. Recent works on unsupervised learning have made considerable progress on perceiving geometry; however, they usually ignore the coherence of objects and perform poorly under scenarios with dark and noisy environments. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms, which are robust, require large labeled geometric dataset. This paper introduces SIGNet, a novel framework that provides robust geometry perception without requiring  geometrically informative labels. Specifically, SIGNet integrates semantic information to make depth and flow predictions consistent with objects and robust to low lighting conditions. SIGNet is shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning for depth prediction by 30% (in squared relative error). In particular, SIGNet improves the dynamic object class performance by 39% in depth prediction and 29% in flow prediction.

133,3D Guided Fine-Grained Face Manipulation,"We present a method for fine-grained face manipulation. Given a face image with an arbitrary expression, our method can synthesize another arbitrary expression by the same person. This is achieved by first fitting a 3D face model and then disentangling the face into a texture and a shape. We then learn different networks in these two spaces. In the texture space, we use a conditional generative network to change the appearance, and carefully design input formats and loss functions to achieve the best results. In the shape space, we use a fully connected network to predict the accurate shapes and use the available depth data for supervision. Both networks are conditioned on expression coefficients rather than discrete labels, allowing us to generate an unlimited amount of expressions. We show the superiority of this disentangling approach through both quantitative and qualitative studies. In a user study, our method is preferred in 85% of cases when compared to the most recent work. When compared to the ground truth, annotators cannot reliably distinguish between our synthesized images and real images, preferring our method in 53% of the cases.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"3D,Guided,Fine-Grained,Face,Manipulation"

To address this issue, we propose to leverage on eye movement dynamics inspired by neurological studies. Studies show that there exist several common eye movement types, independent of viewing contents and subjects, such as fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuits. Incorporating generic eye movement dynamics can therefore improve the generalization capabilities. In particular, we propose a novel Dynamic Gaze Transition Network (DGTN) to capture the underlying eye movement dynamics and serve as the topdown gaze prior. Combined with the bottom-up gaze measurements from the deep convolutional neural network, our method achieves better performance for both within-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations compared to state-of-the-art.

Substantial previous research has only been able to address the ambiguity of ""what describes the expression"", which assumes that each facial expression is associated with one or more predefined affective labels while ignoring the fact that multiple emotions always have different intensities in a single picture. Therefore, to depict facial expressions more accurately, this paper adopts a label distribution learning approach for emotion recognition that can address the ambiguity of ""how to describe the expression"" and proposes an emotion distribution learning method that exploits label correlations locally. Moreover, a local low-rank structure is employed to capture the local label correlations implicitly. Experiments on benchmark facial expression datasets demonstrate that our method can better address the emotion distribution recognition problem than state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Facial,Emotion,Distribution,Learning,by,Exploiting,Low-Rank,Label,Correlations,Locally"
136,Unsupervised Face Normalization With Extreme Pose and Expression in the Wild,"Face recognition achieves great success thanks to the emergence of deep learning. However, many contemporary face recognition models still have limited invariance to strong intra-personal variations such as large pose changes. Face normalization provides an effective and cheap way to distil face identity and dispel face variances for recognition. We focus on face generation in the wild with unpaired data. To this end, we propose a Face Normalization Model (FNM) to generate a frontal, neutral expression, photorealistic face image for face recognition. FNM is a well-designed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with three distinct novelties. First, a face expert network is introduced to construct generator and provide the ability of retaining face identity. Second, with the reconstruction of normal face, pixel-wise loss is applied to stabilize optimization process. Third, we present a series of face attention discriminators to refine local textures. FNM could recover canonical-view, expression-free image and directly improve the performance of face recognition model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild databases demonstrate the superiority of our face normalization method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Face,Normalization,With,Extreme,Pose,and,Expression,in,the,Wild"

There still exist, however, two major issues, i.e., insufficient visual quality (or resolution) of the results and lack of user control. They limit the applicability of existing methods since users may have different editing preference on facial attributes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a semantic component model. The model decomposes a facial attribute into multiple semantic components, each corresponds to a specific face region. This not only allows for user control of edit strength on different parts based on their preference, but also makes it effective to remove unwanted edit effect. Further, each semantic component is composed of two fundamental elements, which determine the edit effect and region respectively. This property provides fine interactive control. As shown in experiments, our model not only produces high-quality results, but also allows effective user interaction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semantic,Component,Decomposition,for,Face,Attribute,Manipulation"
138,R3 Adversarial Network for Cross Model Face Recognition,"In this paper, we raise a new problem, namely cross model face recognition (CMFR), which has considerable economic and social significance. The core of this problem is to make features extracted from different models comparable. However, the diversity, mainly caused by different application scenarios, frequent version updating, and all sorts of service platforms, obstructs interaction among different models and poses a great challenge. To solve this problem, from the perspective of Bayesian modelling, we propose R3 Adversarial Network (R3AN) which consists of three paths: Reconstruction, Representation and Regression. We also introduce adversarial learning into the reconstruction path for better performance. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the feasibility of interaction among different models with the proposed framework. When updating the gallery, R3AN conducts the feature transformation nearly 10 times faster than ResNet-101.  Meanwhile, the transformed feature distribution is very close to that of target model, and its error rate is incredibly reduced by approximately 75% compared with a naive transformation model. Furthermore, we show that face feature can be deciphered into original face image roughly by the reconstruction path, which may give valuable hints for improving the original face recognition models.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"R3,Adversarial,Network,for,Cross,Model,Face,Recognition"
139,Disentangling Latent Hands for Image Synthesis and Pose Estimation,"Hand image synthesis and pose estimation from RGB images are both highly challenging tasks due to the large discrepancy between factors of variation ranging from image background content to camera viewpoint. To better analyze these factors of variation, we propose the use of disentangled representations and a disentangled variational autoencoder (dVAE) that allows for specific sampling and inference of these factors. The derived objective from the variational lower bound as well as the proposed training strategy are highly flexible, allowing us to handle crossmodal encoders and decoders as well as semi-supervised learning scenarios. Experiments show that our dVAE can synthesize highly realistic images of the hand specifiable by both pose and image background content and also estimate 3D hand poses from RGB images with accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art on two public benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Disentangling,Latent,Hands,for,Image,Synthesis,and,Pose,Estimation"
140,Generating Multiple Hypotheses for 3D Human Pose Estimation With Mixture Density Network,"3D human pose estimation from a monocular image or 2D joints is an ill-posed problem because of depth ambiguity and occluded joints. We argue that 3D human pose estimation from a monocular input is an inverse problem where multiple feasible solutions can exist. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate multiple feasible hypotheses of the 3D pose from 2D joints. In contrast to existing deep learning approaches which minimize a mean square error based on an unimodal Gaussian distribution, our method is able to generate multiple feasible hypotheses of 3D pose based on a multimodal mixture density networks.  Our experiments show that the 3D poses estimated by our approach from an input of 2D joints are consistent in 2D reprojections, which supports our argument that multiple solutions exist for the 2D-to-3D inverse problem. Furthermore, we show state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M dataset in both best hypothesis and multi-view settings, and we demonstrate the generalization capacity of our model by testing on the MPII and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

Our main contributions lie in designing a new pose regression network architecture named CrossInfoNet. The proposed CrossInfoNet decomposes hand pose estimation task into palm pose estimation sub-task and finger pose estimation sub-task, and adopts two-branch crossconnection structure to share the beneficial complementary information between the sub-tasks. Our work is inspired by multi-task information sharing mechanism, which has been few discussed in hand pose estimation using depth data in previous publications. In addition, we propose a heat-map guided feature extraction structure to get better feature maps, and train the complete network end-to-end. The effectiveness of the proposed CrossInfoNet is evaluated with extensively self-comparative experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art methods on four public hand pose datasets.

142,P2SGrad: Refined Gradients for Optimizing Deep Face Models,"Cosine-based softmax losses significantly improve the performance of deep face recognition networks. However, these losses always include sensitive hyper-parameters which can make training process unstable, and it is very tricky to set suitable hyper parameters for a specific dataset. This paper addresses this challenge by directly designing the gradients for training in an adaptive manner. We first investigate and unify previous cosine softmax losses from the perspective of gradients. This unified view inspires us to propose a novel gradient called P2SGrad (Probability-to-Similarity Gradient), which leverages a cosine similarity instead of classification probability to control the gradients for updating neural network parameters. P2SGrad is adaptive and hyper-parameter free, which makes training process more efficient and faster. We evaluate our P2SGrad on three face recognition benchmarks, LFW, MegaFace, and IJB-C. The results show that P2SGrad is stable in training, robust to noise, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the three benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"P2SGrad:,Refined,Gradients,for,Optimizing,Deep,Face,Models"
143,Action Recognition From Single Timestamp Supervision in Untrimmed Videos,"Recognising actions in videos relies on labelled supervision during training, typically the start and end times of each action instance. This supervision is not only subjective, but also expensive to acquire. Weak video-level supervision has been successfully exploited for recognition in untrimmed videos, however it is challenged when the number of different actions in training videos increases. We propose a method that is supervised by single timestamps located around each action instance, in untrimmed videos. We replace expensive action bounds with sampling distributions initialised from these timestamps. We then use the classifier's response to iteratively update the sampling distributions. We demonstrate that these distributions converge to the location and extent of discriminative action segments. We evaluate our method on three datasets for fine-grained recognition, with increasing number of different actions per video, and show that single timestamps offer a reasonable compromise between recognition performance and labelling effort, performing comparably to full temporal supervision. Our update method improves top-1 test accuracy by up to 5.4%. across the evaluated datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Action,Recognition,From,Single,Timestamp,Supervision,in,Untrimmed,Videos"
144,Time-Conditioned Action Anticipation in One Shot,"The goal of human action anticipation is to predict future actions. Ideally, in real-world applications such as video surveillance and self-driving systems, future actions should not only be predicted with high accuracy but also at arbitrary and variable time-horizons ranging from short- to long-term predictions. Current work mostly focuses on predicting the next action and thus long-term prediction is achieved by recursive prediction of each next action, which is both inefficient and accumulates errors. In this paper, we propose a novel time-conditioned method for efficient and effective long-term action anticipation. There are two key ingredients to our approach. First, by explicitly conditioning our anticipation network on time allows to efficiently anticipate also long-term actions. And second, we propose an attended temporal feature and a time-conditioned skip connection to extract relevant and useful information from observations for effective anticipation. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Epic-Kitchen and the 50Salads Datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of anticipating future actions at both short-term and long-term, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Time-Conditioned,Action,Anticipation,in,One,Shot"

The two-stream detection network based on RGB and flow provides state-of-the-art accuracy at the expense of a large model-size and heavy computation. We propose to embed RGB and optical-flow into a single two-in-one stream network with new layers. A motion condition layer extracts motion information from flow images, which is leveraged by the motion modulation layer to generate transformation parameters for modulating the low-level RGB features. The method is easily embedded in existing appearance- or two-stream action detection networks, and trained end-to-end. Experiments demonstrate that leveraging the motion condition to modulate RGB features improves detection accuracy. With only half the computation and parameters of the state-of-the-art two-stream methods, our two-in-one stream still achieves impressive results on UCF101-24, UCFSports and J-HMDB.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dance,With,Flow:,Two-In-One,Stream,Action,Detection"

Its parameters for iterative flow optimization are learned in an end-to-end fashion together with the other CNN model parameters, maximizing the action recognition performance. Furthermore, we newly introduce the concept of learning `flow of flow' representations by stacking multiple representation flow layers. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations, confirming its advantages over previous recognition models using traditional optical flows in both computational speed and performance.

It requires a fine-grained discrimination of small objects and their manipulation. While some methods base on strong supervision and attention mechanisms, they are either annotation consuming or do not take spatio-temporal patterns into account. In this paper we propose LSTA as a mechanism to focus on features from spatial relevant parts while attention is being tracked smoothly across the video sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LSTA on egocentric activity recognition with an end-to-end trainable two-stream architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four standard benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LSTA:,Long,Short-Term,Attention,for,Egocentric,Action,Recognition"
148,Learning Actor Relation Graphs for Group Activity Recognition,"Modeling relation between actors is important for recognizing group activity in a multi-person scene. This paper aims at learning discriminative relation between actors efficiently using deep models. To this end, we propose to build a flexible and efficient  \rm Actor Relation Graph  (ARG) to simultaneously capture the appearance and position relation between actors. Thanks to the Graph Convolutional Network, the connections in ARG could be automatically learned from group activity videos in an end-to-end manner, and the inference on ARG could be efficiently performed with standard matrix operations. Furthermore, in practice, we come up with two variants to sparsify ARG for more effective modeling in videos: spatially localized ARG and temporal randomized ARG. We perform extensive experiments on two standard group activity recognition datasets: the Volleyball dataset and the Collective Activity dataset, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved on both datasets. We also visualize the learned actor graphs and relation features, which demonstrate that the proposed ARG is able to capture the discriminative relation information for group activity recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Actor,Relation,Graphs,for,Group,Activity,Recognition"
149,A Structured Model for Action Detection,"A dominant paradigm for learning-based approaches in computer vision is training generic models, such as ResNet for image recognition, or I3D for video understanding, on large datasets and allowing them to discover the optimal representation for the problem at hand. While this is an obviously attractive approach, it is not applicable in all scenarios. We claim that action detection is one such challenging problem - the models that need to be trained are large, and labeled data is expensive to obtain. To address this limitation, we propose to incorporate domain knowledge into the structure of the model, simplifying optimization. In particular, we augment a standard I3D network with a tracking module to aggregate long-term motion patterns, and use a graph convolutional network to reason about interactions between actors and objects. Evaluated on the challenging AVA dataset, the proposed approach improves over the I3D baseline by 5.5% mAP and over the state-of-the-art by 4.8% mAP.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Structured,Model,for,Action,Detection"
150,Out-Of-Distribution Detection for Generalized Zero-Shot Action Recognition,"Generalized zero-shot action recognition is a challenging problem, where the task is to recognize new action categories that are unavailable during the training stage, in addition to the seen action categories. Existing approaches suffer from the inherent bias of the learned classifier towards the seen action categories. As a consequence, unseen category samples are incorrectly classified as belonging to one of the seen action categories. In this paper, we set out to tackle this issue by arguing for a separate treatment of seen and unseen action categories in generalized zero-shot action recognition. We introduce an out-of-distribution detector that  determines whether the video features belong to a seen or unseen action category. To train our out-of-distribution detector, video features for unseen action categories are synthesized using generative adversarial networks trained on seen action category features. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an out-of-distribution detector based GZSL framework for action recognition in videos. Experiments are performed on three action recognition datasets: Olympic Sports, HMDB51 and UCF101. For generalized zero-shot action recognition, our proposed approach outperforms the baseline with absolute gains (in classification accuracy) of 7.0%, 3.4%, and 4.9%, respectively, on these datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Out-Of-Distribution,Detection,for,Generalized,Zero-Shot,Action,Recognition"

We introduce a novel pixel-trajectory recurrent neural network that learns feature embeddings of foreground pixel trajectories linked across time. By clustering the pixel trajectories using the learned feature embeddings, our method establishes correspondences between foreground object masks across video frames. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for object discovery, we conduct experiments on commonly used datasets for motion segmentation, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Object,Discovery,in,Videos,as,Foreground,Motion,Clustering"
152,Towards Natural and Accurate Future Motion Prediction of Humans and Animals,"Anticipating the future motions of 3D articulate objects is challenging due to its non-linear and highly stochastic nature. Current approaches typically represent the skeleton of an articulate object as a set of 3D joints, which unfortunately ignores the relationship between joints, and fails to encode fine-grained anatomical constraints. Moreover, conventional recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM and GRU, are employed to model motion contexts, which inherently have difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies. To address these problems, we propose to explicitly encode anatomical constraints by modeling their skeletons with a Lie algebra representation. Importantly, a hierarchical recurrent network structure is developed to simultaneously encodes local contexts of individual frames and global contexts of the sequence. We proceed to explore the applications of our approach to several distinct quantities including human, fish, and mouse. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves more natural and accurate predictions over state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Natural,and,Accurate,Future,Motion,Prediction,of,Humans,and,Animals"

The proposed method models facial structures and the longitudinal face-aging process of given subjects coherently across video frames. The approach is optimized using a long-term reward,  Reinforcement Learning function with deep feature extraction from Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Unlike previous age-progression methods that are only able to synthesize an aged likeness of a face from a single input image, the proposed approach is capable of age-progressing facial likenesses in videos with consistently synthesized facial features across frames. In addition, the deep reinforcement learning method guarantees preservation of the visual identity of input faces after age-progression. Results on videos of our new collected aging face AGFW-v2 database demonstrate the advantages of the  proposed solution in terms of both quality of age-progressed faces, temporal smoothness, and cross-age face verification.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Automatic,Face,Aging,in,Videos,via,Deep,Reinforcement,Learning"

Many face anti-spoofing methods have been proposed, but they cannot generalize well on ""unseen"" attacks. This work focuses on improving the generalization ability of face anti-spoofing methods from the perspective of the domain generalization. We propose to learn a generalized feature space via a novel multi-adversarial discriminative deep domain generalization framework. In this framework, a multi-adversarial deep domain generalization is performed under a dual-force triplet-mining constraint. This ensures that the learned feature space is discriminative and shared by multiple source domains, and thus is more generalized to new face presentation attacks. An auxiliary face depth supervision is incorporated to further enhance the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Adversarial,Discriminative,Deep,Domain,Generalization,for,Face,Presentation,Attack,Detection"
155,A Content Transformation Block for Image Style Transfer,"Style transfer has recently received a lot of attention, since it allows to study fundamental challenges in image understanding and synthesis. Recent work has significantly improved the representation of color and texture and com- putational speed and image resolution. The explicit transformation of image content has, however, been mostly neglected: while artistic style affects formal characteristics of an image, such as color, shape or texture, it also deforms, adds or removes content details. This paper explicitly focuses on a content-and style-aware stylization of a content image. Therefore, we introduce a content transformation module between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, we utilize similar content appearing in photographs and style samples to learn how style alters content details and we generalize this to other class details. Additionally, this work presents a novel normalization layer critical for high resolution image synthesis. The robustness and speed of our model enables a video stylization in real-time and high definition. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate the validity of our approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Content,Transformation,Block,for,Image,Style,Transfer"

Therefore, a recent line of studies proposes to transfer the makeup from a given reference makeup image to the source non-makeup one. However, it is still challenging due to the massive number of makeup combinations. To facilitate on-demand makeup transfer, in this work, we propose BeautyGlow that decompose the latent vectors of face images derived from the Glow model into makeup and non-makeup latent vectors. Since there is no paired dataset, we formulate a new loss function to guide the decomposition. Afterward, the non-makeup latent vector of a source image and makeup latent vector of a reference image and are effectively combined and revert back to the image domain to derive the results. Experimental results show that the transfer quality of BeautyGlow is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods, while the unique ability to manipulate latent vectors allows BeautyGlow to realize on-demand makeup transfer.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"BeautyGlow:,On-Demand,Makeup,Transfer,Framework,With,Reversible,Generative,Network"

We extend our method to allow user specified point-to-point or region-to-region control over visual similarity between the style image and the output. Such guidance can be used to either achieve a particular visual effect or correct errors made by unconstrained style transfer. In order to quantitatively compare our method to prior work, we conduct a large-scale user study designed to assess the style-content tradeoff across settings in style transfer algorithms. Our results indicate that for any desired level of content preservation, our method provides higher quality stylization than prior work.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Style,Transfer,by,Relaxed,Optimal,Transport,and,Self-Similarity"
158,Inserting Videos Into Videos,"In this paper, we introduce a new problem of manipulating a given video by inserting other videos into it. Our main task is, given an object video and a scene video, to insert the object video at a user-specified location in the scene video so that the resulting video looks realistic. We aim to handle different object motions and complex backgrounds without expensive segmentation annotations. As it is difficult to collect training pairs for this problem, we synthesize fake training pairs that can provide helpful supervisory signals when training a neural network with unpaired real data. The proposed network architecture can take both real and fake pairs as input and perform both supervised and unsupervised training in an adversarial learning scheme. To synthesize a realistic video, the network renders each frame based on the current input and previous frames. Within this framework, we observe that injecting noise into previous frames while generating the current frame stabilizes training. We conduct experiments on real-world videos in object tracking and person re-identification benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to synthesize long sequences of realistic videos with a given object video inserted.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Inserting,Videos,Into,Videos"

Recent advances have shown a great potential of learning based image and video compression. Inspired from related works, in this paper, we present an image compression architecture using a convolutional autoencoder, and then generalize image compression to video compression, by adding an interpolation loop into both encoder and decoder sides. Our basic idea is to realize spatial-temporal energy compaction in learning image and video compression. Thereby, we propose to add a spatial energy compaction-based penalty into loss function, to achieve higher image compression performance. Furthermore, based on temporal energy distribution, we propose to select the number of frames in one interpolation loop, adapting to the motion characteristics of video contents. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed image compression outperforms the latest image compression standard with MS-SSIM quality metric, and provides higher performance compared with state-of-the-art learning compression methods at high bit rates, which benefits from our spatial energy compaction approach. Meanwhile, our proposed video compression approach with temporal energy compaction can significantly outperform MPEG-4, and is competitive with commonly used H.264.

160,Event-Based High Dynamic Range Image and Very High Frame Rate Video Generation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Event cameras have a lot of advantages over traditional cameras, such as low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. However, since the outputs of event cameras are the sequences of asynchronous events over time rather than actual intensity images, existing algorithms could not be directly applied. Therefore, it is demanding to generate intensity images from events for other tasks. In this paper, we unlock the potential of event camera-based conditional generative adversarial networks to create images/videos from an adjustable portion of the event data stream. The stacks of space-time coordinates of events are used as inputs and the network is trained to reproduce images based on the spatio-temporal intensity changes. The usefulness of event cameras to generate high dynamic range (HDR) images even in extreme illumination conditions and also non blurred images under rapid motion is also shown. In addition, the possibility of generating very high frame rate videos is demonstrated, theoretically up to 1 million frames per second(FPS) since the temporal resolution of event cameras is about 1 microsecond.  Proposed methods are evaluated by comparing the results with the intensity images captured on the same pixel grid-line of  events using online available real datasets and synthetic datasets produced by the event camera simulator.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Event-Based,High,Dynamic,Range,Image,and,Very,High,Frame,Rate,Video,Generation,Using,Conditional,Generative,Adversarial,Networks"

To improve both instance synthesis and classification in this setting, we propose an enhanced TripleGAN (EnhancedTGAN) model in this work. We follow the adversarial training scheme of the original TripleGAN, but completely re-design the training targets of the generator and classifier. Specifically, we adopt feature-semantics matching to enhance the generator in learning class-conditional distributions from both the aspects of statistics in the latent space and semantics consistency with respect to the generator and classifier. Since a limited amount of labeled data is not sufficient to determine satisfactory decision boundaries, we include two classifiers, and incorporate collaborative learning into our model to provide better guidance for generator training. The synthesized high-fidelity data can in turn be used for improving classifier training. In the experiments, the superior performance of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the mutual reinforcement between the generator and classifiers in facilitating semi-supervised instance synthesis and classification.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Enhancing,TripleGAN,for,Semi-Supervised,Conditional,Instance,Synthesis,and,Classification"

This is due to the lack of available 3D datasets, models, and standard evaluation metrics. To address this, we introduce a unique 4D face dataset with about 29 minutes of 4D scans captured at 60 fps and synchronized audio from 12 speakers. We then train a neural network on our dataset that factors identity from facial motion. The learned model, VOCA (Voice Operated Character Animation) takes any speech signal as input--even speech in languages other than English--and realistically animates a wide range of adult faces. Conditioning on subject labels during training allows the model to learn a variety of realistic speaking styles. VOCA also provides animator controls to alter speaking style, identity-dependent facial shape, and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball rotations) during animation. To our knowledge, VOCA is the only realistic 3D facial animation model that is readily applicable to unseen subjects without retargeting. This makes VOCA suitable for tasks like in-game video, virtual reality avatars, or any scenario in which the speaker, speech, or language is not known in advance.

The rays captured by multiple light field cameras form subsets of full rays in 3D space and can be transformed to each other. However, most previous approaches model the projection from an arbitrary point in 3D space to corresponding pixel on the sensor. There are  few models on describing the ray sampling and transformation among multiple light field cameras. In the paper, we propose a novel ray-space projection model to transform sets of rays captured by multiple light field cameras in term of the Plucker coordinates. We first derive a 6x6 ray-space intrinsic matrix based on multi-projection-center (MPC) model. A homogeneous ray-space projection matrix and a fundamental matrix are then proposed to establish ray-ray correspondences among multiple light fields. Finally, based on the ray-space projection matrix, a novel camera calibration method is proposed to verify the proposed model. A linear constraint and a ray-ray cost function are established for linear initial solution and non-linear optimization respectively.

165,Deep Geometric Prior for Surface Reconstruction,"The reconstruction of a discrete surface from a point cloud is a fundamental geometry processing problem that has been studied for decades, with many methods developed. We propose the use of a deep neural network as a geometric prior for surface reconstruction. Specifically, we overfit a neural network representing a local chart parameterization to part of an input point cloud using the Wasserstein distance as a measure of approximation. By jointly fitting many such networks to overlapping parts of the point cloud, while enforcing a consistency condition, we compute a manifold atlas. By sampling this atlas, we can produce a dense reconstruction of the surface approximating the input cloud. The entire procedure does not require any training data or explicit regularization, yet, we show that it is able to perform remarkably well: not introducing typical overfitting artifacts, and approximating sharp features closely at the same time. We experimentally show that this geometric prior produces good results for both man-made objects containing sharp features and smoother organic objects, as well as noisy inputs. We compare our method with a number of well-known reconstruction methods on a standard surface  reconstruction benchmark.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Geometric,Prior,for,Surface,Reconstruction"

However, the requirements of professional and expensive hardware for capturing hyperspectral images impede its wide applications. In this paper, based on a simple but not widely noticed phenomenon that the color printer can print color masks with a large number of independent spectral transmission responses, we propose a simple and low-budget scheme to capture the hyperspectral images with a random mask printed by the consumer-level color printer. Specifically, we notice that the printed dots with different colors are stacked together, forming multiplicative, instead of additive, spectral transmission responses. Therefore, new spectral transmission response uncorrelated with that of the original printer dyes are generated. With the random printed color mask, hyperspectral images could be captured in a snapshot way. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based method is developed to reconstruct the hyperspectral images from the captured image.

This model is trained such that it a) reconstructs the appearance of the sky, and b) renders the appearance of objects lit by this illumination. We use this network to label a large-scale dataset of LDR panoramas with lighting parameters and use them to train our single image outdoor lighting estimation network.

Based on the observation that a good intermediate estimate of latent image for estimating motion-blur kernel  is not necessarily the one closest to latent image, edge selection has proven itself a very powerful technique for achieving state-of-the-art performance in blind deblurring. This paper presented an interpretation of edge selection/reweighting in terms of variational Bayes inference, and therefore developed a novel variational expectation maximization (VEM) algorithm with built-in adaptive edge selection for blind deblurring. Together with   a restart strategy for avoiding undesired local convergence, the proposed VEM method  not only has a solid mathematical foundation but also noticeably outperformed the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Variational,EM,Framework,With,Adaptive,Edge,Selection,for,Blind,Motion,Deblurring"
170,Viewport Proposal CNN for 360deg Video Quality Assessment,"Recent years have witnessed the growing interest in visual quality assessment (VQA) for 360deg video. Unfortunately, the existing VQA approaches do not consider the facts that: 1) Observers only see viewports of 360deg video, rather than patches or whole 360deg frames. 2) Within the viewport, only salient regions can be perceived by observers with high resolution. Thus, this paper proposes a viewport-based convolutional neural network (V-CNN) approach for VQA on 360deg video, considering both auxiliary tasks of viewport proposal and viewport saliency prediction. Our V-CNN approach is composed of two stages, i.e., viewport proposal and VQA. In the first stage, the viewport proposal network (VP-net) is developed to yield several potential viewports, seen as the first auxiliary task. In the second stage, a viewport quality network (VQ-net) is designed to rate the VQA score for each proposed viewport, in which the saliency map of the viewport is predicted and then utilized in VQA score rating. Consequently, another auxiliary task of viewport saliency prediction can be achieved. More importantly, the main task of VQA on 360deg video can be accomplished via integrating the VQA scores of all viewports. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our V-CNN approach in significantly advancing the state-of-the-art performance of VQA on 360deg video. In addition, our approach achieves comparable performance in two auxiliary tasks. The code of our V-CNN approach is available at https://github.com/Archer-Tatsu/V-CNN.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Viewport,Proposal,CNN,for,360deg,Video,Quality,Assessment"
171,Beyond Gradient Descent for Regularized Segmentation Losses,"The simplicity of gradient descent (GD) made it the default method for training ever-deeper and complex neural networks. Both loss functions and architectures are often explicitly tuned to be amenable to this basic local optimization. In the context of weakly-supervised CNN segmentation, we demonstrate a well-motivated loss function where an alternative optimizer (ADM) achieves the state-of-the-art while GD performs poorly. Interestingly, GD obtains its best result for a ""smoother"" tuning of the loss function. The results are consistent across different network architectures. Our loss is motivated by well-understood MRF/CRF regularization models in ""shallow"" segmentation and their known global solvers. Our work suggests that network design/training should pay more attention to optimization methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Beyond,Gradient,Descent,for,Regularized,Segmentation,Losses"
172,MAGSAC: Marginalizing Sample Consensus,"A method called, sigma-consensus, is proposed to eliminate the need for a user-defined inlier-outlier threshold in RANSAC. Instead of estimating the noise sigma, it is marginalized over a range of noise scales. The optimized model is obtained by weighted least-squares fitting where the weights come from the marginalization over sigma of the point likelihoods of being inliers. A new quality function is proposed not requiring sigma and, thus, a set of inliers to determine the model quality. Also, a new termination criterion for RANSAC is built on the proposed marginalization approach. Applying sigma-consensus, MAGSAC is proposed with no need for a user-defined sigma and improving the accuracy of robust estimation significantly. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy on publicly available real-world datasets for epipolar geometry (F and E) and homography estimation. In addition, applying sigma-consensus only once as a post-processing step to the RANSAC output always improved the model quality on a wide range of vision problems without noticeable deterioration in processing time, adding a few milliseconds.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MAGSAC:,Marginalizing,Sample,Consensus"
173,Understanding and Visualizing Deep Visual Saliency Models,"Recently, data-driven deep saliency models have achieved high performance and have outperformed classical saliency models, as demonstrated by results on datasets such as the MIT300 and SALICON. Yet, there remains a large gap between the performance of these models and the inter-human baseline. Some outstanding questions include what have these models learned, how and where they fail, and how they can be improved. This article attempts to answer these questions by analyzing the representations learned by individual neurons located at the intermediate layers of deep saliency models. To this end, we follow the steps of existing deep saliency models, that is borrowing a pre-trained model of object recognition to encode the visual features and learning a decoder to infer the saliency. We consider two cases when the encoder is used as a fixed feature extractor and when it is fine-tuned, and compare the inner representations of the network. To study how the learned representations depend on the task, we fine-tune the same network using the same image set but for two different tasks: saliency prediction versus scene classification. Our analyses reveal that: 1) some visual regions (e.g. head, text, symbol, vehicle) are already encoded within various layers of the network pre-trained for object recognition, 2) using modern datasets, we find that fine-tuning pre-trained models for saliency prediction makes them favor some categories (e.g. head) over some others (e.g. text), 3) although deep models of saliency outperform classical models on natural images, the converse is true for synthetic stimuli (e.g. pop-out search arrays), an evidence of significant difference between human and data-driven saliency models, and 4) we confirm that, after-fine tuning, the change in inner-representations is mostly due to the task and not the domain shift in the data",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Understanding,and,Visualizing,Deep,Visual,Saliency,Models"
174,Divergence Prior and Vessel-Tree Reconstruction,"We propose a new geometric regularization principle for reconstructing vector fields based on prior knowledge about their divergence. As one important example  of this general idea, we focus on vector fields modelling blood flow pattern that should be divergent in arteries and convergent in veins. We show that this previously ignored  regularization constraint can significantly improve the quality of vessel tree reconstruction particularly around   bifurcations where non-zero divergence is concentrated. Our divergence prior is critical for resolving (binary) sign ambiguity in flow orientations produced by standard vessel filters, e.g. Frangi.  Our vessel tree centerline reconstruction combines divergence constraints   with robust curvature regularization. Our unsupervised method can reconstruct complete vessel trees with near-capillary details on synthetic and real 3D volumes.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Divergence,Prior,and,Vessel-Tree,Reconstruction"

In this paper, we present an unsupervised method for domain-specific, single-image deblurring based on disentangled representations. The disentanglement is achieved by splitting the content and blur features in a blurred image using content encoders and blur encoders. We enforce a KL divergence loss to regularize the distribution range of extracted blur attributes such that little content information is contained. Meanwhile, to handle the unpaired training data, a blurring branch and the cycle-consistency loss are added to guarantee that the content structures of the deblurred results match the original images. We also add an adversarial loss on deblurred results to generate visually realistic images and a perceptual loss to further mitigate the artifacts. We perform extensive experiments on the tasks of face and text deblurring using both synthetic datasets and real images, and achieve improved results compared to recent state-of-the-art deblurring methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Domain-Specific,Deblurring,via,Disentangled,Representations"
176,Douglas-Rachford Networks: Learning Both the Image Prior and Data Fidelity Terms for Blind Image Deconvolution,"Blind deconvolution problems are heavily ill-posed where the specific blurring kernel is not known. Recovering these images typically requires estimates of the kernel. In this paper, we present a method called Dr-Net, which does not require any such estimate and is further able to invert the effects of the blurring in blind image recovery tasks. These image recovery problems typically have two terms, the data fidelity term (for faithful reconstruction) and the image prior (for realistic looking reconstructions). We use the Douglas-Rachford iterations to solve this problem since it is a more generally applicable optimization procedure than methods such as the proximal gradient descent algorithm. Two proximal operators originate from these iterations, one from the data fidelity term and the second from the image prior. It is non-trivial to design a hand-crafted function to represent these proximal operators for the data fidelity and the image prior terms which would work with real-world image distributions. We therefore approximate both these proximal operators using deep networks. This provides a sound motivation for the final architecture for Dr-Net which we find outperforms the state-of-the-art on two mainstream blind deconvolution benchmarks. We also find that Dr-Net is one of the fastest algorithms according to wall-clock times while doing so.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Douglas-Rachford,Networks:,Learning,Both,the,Image,Prior,and,Data,Fidelity,Terms,for,Blind,Image,Deconvolution"
177,Speed Invariant Time Surface for Learning to Detect Corner Points With Event-Based Cameras,"We propose a learning approach to  corner detection for event-based cameras that is stable  even under fast and  abrupt motions.  Event-based cameras  offer high temporal resolution, power efficiency, and high dynamic range.  However, the  properties of  event-based data  are  very different  compared to  standard intensity  images, and  simple  extensions of  corner detection  methods designed for  these images do  not perform well  on event-based data.   We first introduce an efficient  way to compute a time surface  that is invariant to the speed  of the objects.  We  then show that we can  train a Random Forest to  recognize events generated by  a moving corner from  our time surface.  Random Forests  are also extremely efficient,  and therefore a good choice to deal with the high capture frequency of event-based cameras ---our implementation  processes up  to 1.6Mev/s  on a  single CPU. Thanks to our  time surface formulation and this  learning approach, our method is  significantly more robust  to abrupt changes of  direction of the  corners  compared to  previous  ones.   Our method  also  naturally assigns a  confidence score  for the  corners, which  can be  useful for postprocessing.   Moreover,  we   introduce  a  high-resolution  dataset suitable for quantitative evaluation  and comparison of corner detection methods for event-based cameras.  We call our approach SILC, for Speed Invariant Learned Corners, and  compare it to the  state-of-the-art with extensive experiments, showing better performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Speed,Invariant,Time,Surface,for,Learning,to,Detect,Corner,Points,With,Event-Based,Cameras"
178,Training Deep Learning Based Image Denoisers From Undersampled Measurements Without Ground Truth and Without Image Prior,"Compressive sensing is a method to recover the original image from undersampled measurements. In order to overcome the ill-posedness of this inverse problem, image priors are used such as sparsity, minimal total-variation, or self-similarity of images. Recently, deep learning based compressive image recovery methods have been proposed and have yielded state-of-the-art performances. They used data-driven approaches instead of hand-crafted image priors to regularize ill-posed inverse problems with undersampled data. Ironically, training deep neural networks (DNNs) for them requires ""clean"" ground truth images, but obtaining the best quality images from undersampled data requires well-trained DNNs. To resolve this dilemma, we propose novel methods based on two well-grounded theories: denoiser-approximate message passing (D-AMP) and Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE). Our proposed methods were able to train deep learning based image denoisers from undersampled measurements without ground truth images and without additional image priors, and to recover images with state-of-the-art qualities from undersampled data. We evaluated our methods for various compressive sensing recovery problems with Gaussian random, coded diffraction pattern, and compressive sensing MRI measurement matrices. Our proposed methods yielded state-of-the-art performances for all cases without ground truth images. Our methods also yielded comparable performances to the methods with ground truth data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Training,Deep,Learning,Based,Image,Denoisers,From,Undersampled,Measurements,Without,Ground,Truth,and,Without,Image,Prior"
179,A Variational Pan-Sharpening With Local Gradient Constraints,"Pan-sharpening aims at fusing spectral and spatial information, which are respectively contained in the multispectral (MS) image and panchromatic (PAN) image, to produce a high resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) image. In this paper, a new variational model based on a local gradient constraint for pan-sharpening is proposed. Different with previous methods that only use global constraints to preserve spatial information, we first consider gradient difference of PAN and HRMS images in different local patches and bands. Then a more accurate spatial preservation based on local gradient constraints is incorporated into the objective to fully utilize spatial information contained in the PAN image. The objective is formulated as a convex optimization problem which minimizes two leastsquares terms and thus very simple and easy to implement. A fast algorithm is also designed to improve efficiency. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous variational algorithms and achieves better generalization than recent deep learning methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Variational,Pan-Sharpening,With,Local,Gradient,Constraints"
180,F-VAEGAN-D2: A Feature Generating Framework for Any-Shot Learning,"When labeled training data is scarce, a promising data augmentation approach is to generate visual features of unknown classes using their attributes. To learn the class conditional distribution of CNN features, these models rely on pairs of image features and class attributes. Hence, they can not make use of the abundance of unlabeled data samples. In this paper, we tackle any-shot learning problems i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, in a unified feature generating framework that operates in both inductive and transductive learning settings. We develop a conditional generative model that combines the strength of VAE and GANs and in addition, via an unconditional discriminator, learns the marginal feature distribution of unlabeled images. We empirically show that our model learns highly discriminative CNN features for five datasets, i.e. CUB, SUN, AWA and ImageNet, and establish a new state-of-the-art in any-shot learning, i.e. inductive and transductive (generalized) zero- and few-shot learning settings.

Our proposed sliced Wasserstein discrepancy (SWD) is designed to capture the natural notion of dissimilarity between the outputs of task-specific classifiers. It provides a geometrically meaningful guidance to detect target samples that are far from the support of the source and enables efficient distribution alignment in an end-to-end trainable fashion. In the experiments, we validate the effectiveness and genericness of our method on digit and sign recognition, image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Sliced,Wasserstein,Discrepancy,for,Unsupervised,Domain,Adaptation"
182,Graph Attention Convolution for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Standard convolution is inherently limited for semantic segmentation of point cloud due to its isotropy about features. It neglects the structure of an object, results in poor object delineation and small spurious regions in the segmentation result. This paper proposes a novel graph attention convolution (GAC), whose kernels can be dynamically carved into specific shapes to adapt to the structure of an object. Specifically, by assigning proper attentional weights to different neighboring points, GAC is designed to selectively focus on the most relevant part of them according to their dynamically learned features. The shape of the convolution kernel is then determined by the learned distribution of the attentional weights. Though simple, GAC can capture the structured features of point clouds for fine-grained segmentation and avoid feature contamination between objects. Theoretically, we provided a thorough analysis on the expressive capabilities of GAC to show how it can learn about the features of point clouds. Empirically, we evaluated the proposed GAC on challenging indoor and outdoor datasets and achieved the state-of-the-art results in both scenarios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Graph,Attention,Convolution,for,Point,Cloud,Semantic,Segmentation"
183,Normalized Diversification,"Generating diverse yet specific data is the goal of the generative adversarial network (GAN), but it suffers from the problem of mode collapse. We introduce the concept of normalized diversity which force the model to preserve the normalized pairwise distance between the sparse samples from a latent parametric distribution and their corresponding high-dimensional outputs. The normalized diversification aims to unfold the manifold of unknown topology and non-uniform distribution, which leads to safe interpolation between valid latent variables. By alternating the maximization over the pairwise distance and updating the total distance (normalizer), we encourage the model to actively explore in the high-dimensional output space. We demonstrate that by combining the normalized diversity loss and the adversarial loss, we generate diverse data without suffering from mode collapsing. Experimental results show that our method achieves consistent improvement on unsupervised image generation, conditional image generation and hand pose estimation over strong baselines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Normalized,Diversification"

As a consequence, higher compression rates can be achieved without loss of localization accuracy when compared to standard coding schemes that optimize for reconstruction, thus ignoring the end task. Our experiments show that it is possible to learn a task-specific compression which reduces storage requirements by two orders of magnitude over general-purpose codecs such as WebP without sacrificing performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Localize,Through,Compressed,Binary,Maps"

To achieve that, we first propose a novel parameterized  model of road layouts in a top-view representation, which is not only intuitive for human visualization but also provides an interpretable interface for higher-level decision making.  Moreover, the design of our top-view scene model allows for efficient sampling and thus generation of large-scale simulated data, which we leverage to train a deep neural network to infer our scene model's parameters.  Specifically, our proposed training procedure uses supervised domain-adaptation techniques to incorporate both simulated as well as manually annotated data.  Finally, we design a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that enforces coherent predictions for a single frame and encourages temporal smoothness among video frames.  Experiments on two public data sets show that: (1) Our parametric top-view model is representative enough to describe complex road scenes; (2) The proposed method outperforms baselines trained on manually-annotated or simulated data only, thus getting the best of both; (3) Our CRF is able to generate temporally smoothed while semantically meaningful results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Parametric,Top-View,Representation,of,Complex,Road,Scenes"

Our method can learn the spatiotemporal representation of the video by predicting the order of shuffled clips from the video. The category of the video is not required, which gives our technique the potential to take advantage of infinite unannotated videos. There exist related works which use frames, while compared to frames, clips are more consistent with the video dynamics. Clips can help to reduce the uncertainty of orders and are more appropriate to learn a video representation. The 3D convolutional neural networks are utilized to extract features for clips, and these features are processed to predict the actual order. The learned representations are evaluated via nearest neighbor retrieval experiments. We also use the learned networks as the pre-trained models and finetune them on the action recognition task.

We demonstrate that superquadrics lead to more expressive 3D scene parses while being easier to learn than 3D cuboid representations. Moreover, we provide an analytical solution to the Chamfer loss which avoids the need for computational expensive reinforcement learning or iterative prediction. Our model learns to parse 3D objects into consistent superquadric representations without supervision.

The appearance generator models the appearance related information, including color, illumination, identity or category, of an image,  while the geometric generator performs geometric related warping, such as rotation and stretching, through generating displacement of the coordinates of each pixel to obtain the final image. Two generators act upon independent latent factors to extract disentangled appearance and geometric information from image. The proposed scheme is general and can be easily integrated into different generative models. An extensive set of qualitative and quantitative experiments show that the appearance and geometric information can be well disentangled, and the learned geometric generator can be conveniently transferred to the other image datasets to facilitate knowledge transfer tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Disentangling,of,Appearance,and,Geometry,by,Deformable,Generator,Network"

The method incorporates rotation invariance into the feature learning framework, one of many good and well-studied properties of visual representation, which is rarely appreciated or exploited by previous deep convolutional neural network based self-supervised representation learning methods. Specifically, our model learns a split representation that contains both rotation related and unrelated parts. We train neural networks by jointly predicting image rotations and discriminating individual instances. In particular, our model decouples the rotation discrimination from instance discrimination, which allows us to improve the rotation prediction by mitigating the influence of rotation label noise, as well as discriminate instances without regard to image rotations. The resulting feature has a better generalization ability for more various tasks. Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on standard self-supervised feature learning benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Supervised,Representation,Learning,by,Rotation,Feature,Decoupling"
190,Weakly Supervised Deep Image Hashing Through Tag Embeddings,"Many approaches to semantic image hashing have been formulated as supervised learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary hash codes. However, large-scale labelled image data is expensive to obtain, thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand, unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contains useful information, although raw tags in general do not readily lead to semantic labels. Motivated by this scenario, we formulate the problem of semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically, we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning. Accordingly, we name our model Weakly Supervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models. Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of weekly supervised image hashing.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly,Supervised,Deep,Image,Hashing,Through,Tag,Embeddings"

Pixel-wise classification fails to predict topologically correct and connected road masks due to the absence of connectivity supervision and difficulty in enforcing topological constraints. In this paper, we propose a connectivity task called Orientation Learning, motivated by the human behavior of annotating roads by tracing it at a specific orientation. We also develop a stacked multi-branch convolutional module to effectively utilize the mutual information between orientation learning and segmentation tasks. These contributions ensure that the model predicts topologically correct and connected road masks. We also propose Connectivity Refinement approach to further enhance the estimated road networks. The refinement model is pre-trained to connect and refine the corrupted ground-truth masks and later fine-tuned to enhance the predicted road masks. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on two diverse road extraction datasets SpaceNet and DeepGlobe.

In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal retrieval method, called Deep Supervised Cross-modal Retrieval (DSCMR). It aims to find a common representation space, in which the samples from different modalities can be compared directly. Specifically, DSCMR minimises the discrimination loss in both the label space and the common representation space to supervise the model learning discriminative features. Furthermore, it simultaneously minimises the modality invariance loss and uses a weight sharing strategy to eliminate the cross-modal discrepancy of multimedia data in the common representation space to learn modality-invariant features. Comprehensive experimental results on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in cross-modal learning and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Supervised,Cross-Modal,Retrieval"
193,A Theoretically Sound Upper Bound on the Triplet Loss for Improving the Efficiency of Deep Distance Metric Learning,"We propose a method that substantially improves the efficiency of deep distance metric learning based on the optimization of the triplet loss function. One epoch of such training process based on a na""ive optimization of the triplet loss function has a run-time complexity O(N^3), where N is the number of training samples. Such optimization scales poorly, and the most common approach proposed to address this high complexity issue is based on sub-sampling the set of triplets needed for the training process. Another approach explored in the field relies on an ad-hoc linearization (in terms of N) of the triplet loss that introduces class centroids, which must be optimized using the whole training set for each mini-batch - this means that a na""ive implementation of this approach has run-time complexity O(N^2). This complexity issue is usually mitigated with poor, but computationally cheap, approximate centroid optimization methods. In this paper, we first propose a solid theory on the linearization of the triplet loss with the use of class centroids, where the main conclusion is that our new linear loss represents a tight upper-bound to the triplet loss. Furthermore, based on the theory above, we propose a training algorithm that no longer requires the centroid optimization step, which means that our approach is the first in the field with a guaranteed linear run-time complexity. We show that the training of deep distance metric learning methods using the proposed upper-bound is substantially faster than triplet-based methods, while producing competitive retrieval accuracy results on benchmark datasets (CUB-200-2011 and CAR196).",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Theoretically,Sound,Upper,Bound,on,the,Triplet,Loss,for,Improving,the,Efficiency,of,Deep,Distance,Metric,Learning"

In this paper, we present Graph Diffusion-Embedding networks (GDENs), a new model for graph-structured data representation and learning. GDENs are motivated by our development of graph based feature diffusion. GDENs integrate both feature diffusion and graph node (low-dimensional) embedding simultaneously into a unified network by employing a novel diffusion-embedding architecture. GDENs have two main advantages. First, the equilibrium representation of the diffusion-embedding operation in GDENs can be obtained via a simple closed-form solution, which thus guarantees the compactivity and efficiency of GDENs. Second, the proposed GDENs can be naturally extended to address the data with multiple graph structures. Experiments on various semi-supervised learning tasks on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed GDENs significantly outperform traditional graph convolutional networks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Data,Representation,and,Learning,With,Graph,Diffusion-Embedding,Networks"

For example, a relationship \ man, open, door\  involves a complex relation \ open\  between concrete entities \ man, door\ . While much of the existing work has studied this problem in the context of still images, understanding visual relationships in videos has received limited attention. Due to their temporal nature, videos enable us to model and reason about a more comprehensive set of visual relationships, such as those requiring multiple (temporal) observations (e.g., \ man, lift up, box\  vs. \ man, put down, box\ ), as well as relationships that are often correlated through time (e.g., \ woman, pay, money\  followed by \ woman, buy, coffee\ ). In this paper, we construct a Conditional Random Field on a fully-connected spatio-temporal graph that exploits the statistical dependency between relational entities spatially and temporally. We introduce a novel gated energy function parametrization that learns adaptive relations conditioned on visual observations.

196,Image-Question-Answer Synergistic Network for Visual Dialog,"The image, question (combined with the history for de-referencing), and the corresponding answer are three vital components of visual dialog. Classical visual dialog systems integrate the image, question, and history to search for or generate the best matched answer, and so, this approach significantly ignores the role of the answer. In this paper, we devise a novel image-question-answer synergistic network to value the role of the answer for precise visual dialog. We extend the traditional one-stage solution to a two-stage solution. In the first stage, candidate answers are coarsely scored according to their relevance to the image and question pair. Afterward, in the second stage, answers with high probability of being correct are re-ranked by synergizing with image and question. On the Visual Dialog v1.0 dataset, the proposed synergistic network boosts the discriminative visual dialog model to achieve a new state-of-the-art of 57.88% normalized discounted cumulative gain. A generative visual dialog model equipped with the proposed technique also shows promising improvements.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Image-Question-Answer,Synergistic,Network,for,Visual,Dialog"
197,Not All Frames Are Equal: Weakly-Supervised Video Grounding With Contextual Similarity and Visual Clustering Losses,"We invest the problem of weakly-supervised video grounding, where only video-level sentences are provided. This is a challenging task, and previous  Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) based image grounding methods turn to fail in the video domain. Recent work attempts to decompose the video-level MIL into frame-level MIL by applying weighted sentence-frame ranking loss over frames, but it is not robust and does not exploit the rich temporal information in videos. In this work, we address these issues by extending frame-level MIL  with a false positive frame-bag constraint and modeling the visual feature consistency in the video. In specific, we design a contextual similarity between semantic and visual features to deal with sparse objects association across frames.  Furthermore, we leverage temporal coherence by strengthening the clustering effect of similar features in the visual space. We conduct an extensive evaluation on YouCookII and RoboWatch datasets, and demonstrate our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Not,All,Frames,Are,Equal:,Weakly-Supervised,Video,Grounding,With,Contextual,Similarity,and,Visual,Clustering,Losses"
198,Inverse Cooking: Recipe Generation From Food Images,"People enjoy food photography because they appreciate food. Behind each meal there is a story described in a complex recipe and, unfortunately, by simply looking at a food image we do not have access to its preparation process. Therefore, in this paper we introduce an inverse cooking system that recreates cooking recipes given food images. Our system predicts ingredients as sets by means of a novel architecture, modeling their dependencies without imposing any order, and then generates cooking instructions by attending to both image and its inferred ingredients simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the whole system on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset and show that (1) we improve performance w.r.t. previous baselines for ingredient prediction; (2) we are able to obtain high quality recipes by leveraging both image and ingredients; (3) our system is able to produce more compelling recipes than retrieval-based approaches according to human judgment. We make code and models publicly available.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Inverse,Cooking:,Recipe,Generation,From,Food,Images"
199,Adversarial Semantic Alignment for Improved Image Captions,"In this paper, we study image captioning as a conditional GAN training, proposing both a context-aware LSTM captioner and co-attentive discriminator, which enforces semantic alignment between images and captions. We empirically focus on the viability of two training methods: Self-critical Sequence Training (SCST) and Gumbel Straight-Through (ST) and demonstrate that SCST shows more stable gradient behavior and improved results over Gumbel ST, even without accessing discriminator gradients directly. We also address the problem of automatic evaluation for captioning models and introduce a new semantic score, and show its correlation to human judgement. As an evaluation paradigm, we argue that an important criterion for a captioner is the ability to generalize to compositions of objects that do not usually co-occur together. To this end, we introduce a small captioned Out of Context (OOC) test set. The OOC set, combined with our semantic score, are the proposed new diagnosis tools for the captioning community. When evaluated on OOC and MS-COCO benchmarks, we show that SCST-based training has a strong performance in both semantic score and human evaluation, promising to be a valuable new approach for efficient discrete GAN training.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Adversarial,Semantic,Alignment,for,Improved,Image,Captions"
200,Answer Them All! Toward Universal Visual Question Answering Models,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) research is split into two camps: the first focuses on VQA datasets that require natural image understanding and the second focuses on synthetic datasets that test reasoning. A good VQA algorithm should be capable of both, but only a few VQA algorithms are tested in this manner. We compare five state-of-the-art VQA algorithms across eight VQA datasets covering both domains. To make the comparison fair, all of the models are standardized as much as possible, e.g., they use the same visual features, answer vocabularies, etc. We find that methods do not generalize across the two domains. To address this problem, we propose a new VQA algorithm that rivals or exceeds the state-of-the-art for both domains.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Answer,Them,All!,Toward,Universal,Visual,Question,Answering,Models"
201,Unsupervised Multi-Modal Neural Machine Translation,"Unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) has recently achieved remarkable results [??] with only large monolingual corpora in each language.  However, the uncertainty of associating target with source sentences makes UNMT theoretically an ill-posed problem.  This work investigates the possibility of utilizing images for disambiguation to improve the performance of UNMT.  Our assumption is intuitively based on the invariant property of image, i.e., the description of the same visual content by different languages should be approximately similar.  We propose an unsupervised multi-modal machine translation (UMNMT) framework based on the language translation cycle consistency loss conditional on the image, targeting to learn the bidirectional multi-modal translation simultaneously.  Through an alternate training between multi-modal and uni-modal, our inference model can translate with or without the image.  On the widely used Multi30K dataset, the experimental results of our approach are significantly better than those of the text-only UNMT on the 2016 test dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Multi-Modal,Neural,Machine,Translation"
202,Multi-Task Learning of Hierarchical Vision-Language Representation,"It is still challenging to build an AI system that can perform tasks that involve vision and language at human level. So far, researchers have singled out individual tasks separately, for each of which they have designed networks and trained them on its dedicated datasets. Although this approach has seen a certain degree of success, it comes with difficulties of understanding relations among different tasks and transferring the knowledge learned for a task to others. We propose a multi-task learning approach that enables to learn vision-language representation that is shared by many tasks from their diverse datasets. The representation is hierarchical, and prediction for each task is computed from the representation at its corresponding level of the hierarchy.  We show through experiments that our method consistently outperforms previous single-task-learning methods on image caption retrieval, visual question answering, and visual grounding. We also analyze the learned hierarchical representation by visualizing attention maps generated in our network.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Task,Learning,of,Hierarchical,Vision-Language,Representation"
203,Cross-Modal Self-Attention Network for Referring Image Segmentation,"We consider the problem of referring image segmentation. Given an input image and a natural language expression, the goal is to segment the object referred by the language expression in the image. Existing works in this area treat the language expression and the input image separately in their representations. They do not sufficiently capture long-range correlations between these two modalities. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal self-attention (CMSA) module that effectively captures the long-range dependencies between linguistic and visual features. Our model can adaptively focus on informative words in the referring expression and important regions in the input image. In addition, we propose a gated multi-level fusion module to selectively integrate self-attentive cross-modal features corresponding to different levels in the image. This module controls the information flow of features at different levels. We validate the proposed approach on four evaluation datasets. Our proposed approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cross-Modal,Self-Attention,Network,for,Referring,Image,Segmentation"
204,DuDoNet: Dual Domain Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction,"Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging modality widely used for medical diagnosis and treatment. CT images are often corrupted by undesirable artifacts when metallic implants are carried by patients, which creates the problem of metal artifact reduction (MAR). Existing methods for reducing the artifacts due to metallic implants are inadequate for two main reasons. First, metal artifacts are structured and non-local so that simple image domain enhancement approaches would not suffice. Second, the MAR approaches which attempt to reduce metal artifacts in the X-ray projection (sinogram) domain inevitably lead to severe secondary artifact due to sinogram inconsistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an end-to-end trainable Dual Domain Network (DuDoNet) to simultaneously restore sinogram consistency and enhance CT images. The linkage between the sigogram and image domains is a novel Radon inversion layer that allows the gradients to back-propagate from the image domain to the sinogram domain during training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant improvements over other single domain MAR approaches. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end dual-domain network for MAR.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DuDoNet:,Dual,Domain,Network,for,CT,Metal,Artifact,Reduction"
205,Fast Spatio-Temporal Residual Network for Video Super-Resolution,"Recently, deep learning based video super-resolution (SR) methods have achieved promising performance. To simultaneously exploit the spatial and temporal information of videos, employing 3-dimensional (3D) convolutions is a natural approach. However, straight utilizing 3D convolutions may lead to an excessively high computational complexity which restricts the depth of video SR models and thus undermine the performance. In this paper, we present a novel fast spatio-temporal residual network (FSTRN) to adopt 3D convolutions for the video SR task in order to enhance the performance while maintaining a low computational load. Specifically, we propose a fast spatio-temporal residual block (FRB) that divide each 3D filter to the product of two 3D filters, which have considerably lower dimensions. Furthermore, we design a cross-space residual learning that directly links the low-resolution space and the high-resolution space, which can greatly relieve the computational burden on the feature fusion and up-scaling parts. Extensive evaluations and comparisons on benchmark datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that the proposed network significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fast,Spatio-Temporal,Residual,Network,for,Video,Super-Resolution"
206,Complete the Look: Scene-Based Complementary Product Recommendation,"Modeling fashion compatibility is challenging due to its complexity and subjectivity. Existing work focuses on predicting compatibility between product images (e.g. an image containing a t-shirt and an image containing a pair of jeans). However, these approaches ignore real-world 'scene' images (e.g. selfies); such images are hard to deal with due to their complexity, clutter, variations in lighting and pose (etc.) but on the other hand could potentially provide key context (e.g. the user's body type, or the season) for making more accurate recommendations. In this work, we propose a new task called 'Complete the Look', which seeks to recommend visually compatible products based on scene images. We design an approach to extract training data for this task, and propose a novel way to learn the scene-product compatibility from fashion or interior design images. Our approach measures compatibility both globally and locally via CNNs and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant performance gains over alternative systems. Human evaluation and qualitative analysis are also conducted to further understand model behavior. We hope this work could lead to useful applications which link large corpora of real-world scenes with shoppable products.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Complete,the,Look:,Scene-Based,Complementary,Product,Recommendation"
207,Selective Sensor Fusion for Neural Visual-Inertial Odometry,"Deep learning approaches for Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) have proven successful, but they rarely focus on incorporating robust fusion strategies for dealing with imperfect input sensory data. We propose a novel end-to-end selective sensor fusion framework for monocular VIO, which fuses monocular images and inertial measurements in order to estimate the trajectory whilst improving robustness to real-life issues, such as missing and corrupted data or bad sensor synchronization. In particular, we propose two fusion modalities based on different masking strategies: deterministic soft fusion and stochastic hard fusion, and we compare with previously proposed direct fusion baselines. During testing, the network is able to selectively process the features of the available sensor modalities and produce a trajectory at scale.  We present a thorough investigation on the performances on three public autonomous driving, Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) and hand-held VIO datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the fusion strategies, which offer better performances compared to direct fusion, particularly in presence of corrupted data. In addition, we study the interpretability of the fusion networks by visualising the masking layers in different scenarios and with varying data corruption, revealing interesting correlations between the fusion networks and imperfect sensory input data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Selective,Sensor,Fusion,for,Neural,Visual-Inertial,Odometry"
208,Look More Than Once: An Accurate Detector for Text of Arbitrary Shapes,"Previous scene text detection methods have progressed substantially over the past years. However, limited by the receptive field of CNNs and the simple representations like rectangle bounding box or quadrangle adopted to describe text, previous methods may fall short when dealing with more challenging text instances, such as extremely long text and arbitrarily shaped text. To address these two problems, we present a novel text detector namely LOMO, which localizes the text progressively for multiple times (or in other word, LOok More than Once). LOMO consists of a direct regressor (DR), an iterative refinement module (IRM) and a shape expression module (SEM). At first, text proposals in the form of quadrangle are generated by DR branch. Next, IRM progressively perceives the entire long text by iterative refinement based on the extracted feature blocks of preliminary proposals. Finally, a SEM is introduced to reconstruct more precise representation of irregular text by considering the geometry properties of text instance, including text region, text center line and border offsets. The state-of-the-art results on several public benchmarks including ICDAR2017-RCTW, SCUT-CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR2015 and ICDAR17-MLT confirm the striking robustness and effectiveness of LOMO.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Look,More,Than,Once:,An,Accurate,Detector,for,Text,of,Arbitrary,Shapes"
209,Learning Binary Code for Personalized Fashion Recommendation,"With the rapid growth of fashion-focused social networks and online shopping, intelligent fashion recommendation is now in great needs. Recommending fashion outfits, each of which is composed of multiple interacted clothing and accessories, is relatively new to the field. The problem becomes even more interesting and challenging when considering users' personalized fashion style. Another challenge in a large-scale fashion outfit recommendation system is the efficiency issue of item/outfit search and storage. In this paper, we propose to learn binary code for efficient personalized fashion outfits recommendation. Our system consists of three components, a feature network for content extraction, a set of type-dependent hashing modules to learn binary codes, and a matching block that conducts pairwise matching. The whole framework is trained in an end-to-end manner. We collect outfit data together with user label information from a fashion-focused social website for the personalized recommendation task. Extensive experiments on our datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly even with a simple backbone.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Binary,Code,for,Personalized,Fashion,Recommendation"
210,Attention Based Glaucoma Detection: A Large-Scale Database and CNN Model,"Recently, the attention mechanism has been successfully applied in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), significantly boosting the performance of many computer vision tasks. Unfortunately, few medical image recognition approaches incorporate the attention mechanism in the CNNs. In particular, there exists high redundancy in fundus images for glaucoma detection, such that the attention mechanism has potential in improving the performance of CNN-based glaucoma detection. This paper proposes an attention-based CNN for glaucoma detection (AG-CNN). Specifically, we first establish a large-scale attention based glaucoma (LAG) database, which includes 5,824 fundus images labeled with either positive glaucoma (2,392) or negative glaucoma (3,432). The attention maps of the ophthalmologists are also collected in LAG database through a simulated eye-tracking experiment. Then, a new structure of AG-CNN is designed, including an attention prediction subnet, a pathological area localization subnet and a glaucoma classification subnet. Different from other attention-based CNN methods, the features are also visualized as the localized pathological area, which can advance the performance of glaucoma detection. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed AG-CNN approach significantly advances state-of-the-art glaucoma detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attention,Based,Glaucoma,Detection:,A,Large-Scale,Database,and,CNN,Model"
211,Privacy Protection in Street-View Panoramas Using Depth and Multi-View Imagery,"The current paradigm in privacy protection in street-view images is to detect and blur sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a framework that is an alternative to blurring, which automatically removes and inpaints moving objects (e.g. pedestrians, vehicles) in street-view imagery. We propose a novel moving object segmentation algorithm exploiting consistencies in depth across multiple street-view images that are later combined with the results of a segmentation network. The detected moving objects are removed and inpainted with information from other views, to obtain a realistic output image such that the moving object is not visible anymore. We evaluate our results on a dataset of 1000 images to obtain a peak noise-to-signal ratio (PSNR) and L 1 loss of 27.2 dB and 2.5%, respectively. To assess overall quality, we also report the results of a survey conducted on 35 professionals, asked to visually inspect the images whether object removal and inpainting had taken place.

212,Grounding Human-To-Vehicle Advice for Self-Driving Vehicles,"Recent success suggests that deep neural control networks are likely to be a key component of self-driving vehicles. These networks are trained on large datasets to imitate human actions, but they lack semantic understanding of image contents. This makes them brittle and potentially unsafe in situations that do not match training data. Here, we propose to address this issue by augmenting training data with natural language advice from a human. Advice includes guidance about what to do and where to attend. We present the first step toward advice giving, where we train an end-to-end vehicle controller that accepts advice. The controller adapts the way it attends to the scene (visual attention) and the control (steering and speed). Attention mechanisms tie controller behavior to salient objects in the advice. We evaluate our model on a novel advisable driving dataset with manually annotated human-to-vehicle advice called Honda Research Institute-Advice Dataset (HAD). We show that taking advice improves the performance of the end-to-end network, while the network cues on a variety of visual features that are provided by advice.

Our motivation is that accurate multi-step prediction of the drivable space can efficiently improve path planning and navigation resulting in safe, comfortable and optimum paths in autonomous driving. We train a variety of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures on the OGM sequences from the KITTI dataset. The results demonstrate significant improvement of the prediction accuracy using our proposed difference learning method, incorporating motion related features, over the state of the art. We remove the egomotion from the OGM sequences by transforming them into a common frame. Although in the transformed sequences the KITTI dataset is heavily biased toward static objects, by learning the difference between consecutive OGMs, our proposed method provides accurate prediction over both the static and moving objects.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Step,Prediction,of,Occupancy,Grid,Maps,With,Recurrent,Neural,Networks"

In this work, we investigate the cross-modal connection between vision and touch. The main challenge in this cross-domain modeling task lies in the significant scale discrepancy between the two: while our eyes perceive an entire visual scene at once, humans can only feel a small region of an object at any given moment. To connect vision and touch, we introduce new tasks of synthesizing plausible tactile signals from visual inputs as well as imagining how we interact with objects given tactile data as input. To accomplish our goals, we first equip robots with both visual and tactile sensors and collect a large-scale dataset of corresponding vision and tactile image sequences. To close the scale gap, we present a new conditional adversarial model that incorporates the scale and location information of the touch. Human perceptual studies demonstrate that our model can produce realistic visual images from tactile data and vice versa. Finally, we present both qualitative and quantitative experimental results regarding different system designs, as well as visualizing the learned representations of our model.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Connecting,Touch,and,Vision,via,Cross-Modal,Prediction"
215,X2CT-GAN: Reconstructing CT From Biplanar X-Rays With Generative Adversarial Networks,"Computed tomography (CT) can provide a 3D view of the patient's internal organs, facilitating disease diagnosis, but it incurs more radiation dose to a patient and a CT scanner is much more cost prohibitive than an X-ray machine too. Traditional CT reconstruction methods require hundreds of X-ray projections through a full rotational scan of the body, which cannot be performed on a typical X-ray machine. In this work, we propose to reconstruct CT from two orthogonal X-rays using the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. A specially designed generator network is exploited to increase data dimension from 2D (X-rays) to 3D (CT), which is not addressed in previous research of GAN. A novel feature fusion method is proposed to combine information from two X-rays. The mean squared error (MSE) loss and adversarial loss are combined to train the generator, resulting in a high-quality CT volume both visually and quantitatively. Extensive experiments on a publicly available chest CT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It could be a nice enhancement of a low-cost X-ray machine to provide physicians a CT-like 3D volume in several niche applications.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"X2CT-GAN:,Reconstructing,CT,From,Biplanar,X-Rays,With,Generative,Adversarial,Networks"

At the core of our method is a fully parallelizable hierarchical probabilistic model for adaptive entropy coding which is optimized end-to-end for the compression task. In contrast to recent autoregressive discrete probabilistic models such as PixelCNN, our method i) models the image distribution jointly with learned auxiliary representations instead of exclusively modeling the image distribution in RGB space, and ii) only requires three forward-passes to predict all pixel probabilities instead of one for each pixel. As a result, L3C obtains over two orders of magnitude speedups when sampling compared to the fastest PixelCNN variant (Multiscale-PixelCNN). Furthermore, we find that learning the auxiliary representation is crucial and outperforms predefined auxiliary representations such as an RGB pyramid significantly.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Practical,Full,Resolution,Learned,Lossless,Image,Compression"
217,Image-To-Image Translation via Group-Wise Deep Whitening-And-Coloring Transformation,"Recently, unsupervised exemplar-based image-to-image translation, conditioned on a given exemplar without the paired data, has accomplished substantial advancements. In order to transfer the information from an exemplar to an input image, existing methods often use a normalization technique, e.g., adaptive instance normalization, that controls the channel-wise statistics of an input activation map at a particular layer, such as the mean and the variance. Meanwhile, style transfer approaches similar task to image translation by nature, demonstrated superior performance by using the higher-order statistics such as covariance among channels in representing a style. In detail, it works via whitening (given a zero-mean input feature, transforming its covariance matrix into the identity). followed by coloring (changing the covariance matrix of the whitened feature to those of the style feature). However, applying this approach in image translation is computationally intensive and error-prone due to the expensive time complexity and its non-trivial backpropagation. In response, this paper proposes an end-to-end approach tailored for image translation that efficiently approximates this transformation with our novel regularization methods. We further extend our approach to a group-wise form for memory and time efficiency as well as image quality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is fast, both in training and inference, and highly effective in reflecting the style of an exemplar.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Image-To-Image,Translation,via,Group-Wise,Deep,Whitening-And-Coloring,Transformation"

However, to model  high-dimensional distributions, sequential training and stacked architectures are  common, increasing the number of tunable hyper-parameters as well as the training time. Nonetheless, the sample complexity of the distance metrics remains one of the factors affecting GAN training. We first show that the recently proposed sliced Wasserstein distance has compelling sample complexity properties when compared to the Wasserstein distance. To further improve the sliced Wasserstein distance we then analyze its `projection complexity' and develop the max-sliced Wasserstein distance which enjoys compelling sample complexity while reducing projection complexity, albeit necessitating a max estimation. We finally illustrate that the proposed distance trains GANs on high-dimensional images up to a resolution of 256x256 easily.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Max-Sliced,Wasserstein,Distance,and,Its,Use,for,GANs"

However, even in the few-shot regime, discriminatively trained linear predictors can offer better generalization. We propose to use these predictors as base learners to learn representations for few-shot learning and show they offer better tradeoffs between feature size and performance across a range of few-shot recognition benchmarks. Our objective is to learn feature embeddings that generalize well under a linear classification rule for novel categories. To efficiently solve the objective, we exploit two properties of linear classifiers: implicit differentiation of the optimality conditions of the convex problem and the dual formulation of the optimization problem. This allows us to use high-dimensional embeddings with improved generalization at a modest increase in computational overhead. Our approach, named MetaOptNet, achieves state-of-the-art performance on miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100 few-shot learning benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Meta-Learning,With,Differentiable,Convex,Optimization"
220,RePr: Improved Training of Convolutional Filters,"A well-trained Convolutional Neural Network can easily be pruned without significant loss of performance. This is because of unnecessary overlap in the features captured by the network's filters. Innovations in network architecture such as skip/dense connections and inception units have mitigated this problem to some extent, but these improvements come with increased computation and memory requirements at run-time. We attempt to address this problem from another angle - not by changing the network structure but by altering the training method. We show that by temporarily pruning and then restoring a subset of the model's filters, and repeating this process cyclically, overlap in the learned features is reduced, producing improved generalization. We show that the existing model-pruning criteria are not optimal for selecting filters to prune in this context, and introduce inter-filter orthogonality as the ranking criteria to determine under-expressive filters. Our method is applicable both to vanilla convolutional networks and more complex modern architectures, and improves the performance across a variety of tasks, especially when applied to smaller networks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"RePr:,Improved,Training,of,Convolutional,Filters"
221,Tangent-Normal Adversarial Regularization for Semi-Supervised Learning,"Compared with standard supervised learning, the key difficulty in semi-supervised learning is how to make full use of the unlabeled data. A recently proposed method, virtual adversarial training (VAT),  smartly performs adversarial training without label information to  impose a local smoothness on the classifier, which is especially beneficial to semi-supervised learning. In this work, we propose tangent-normal adversarial regularization (TNAR) as an extension of VAT by taking the data manifold into consideration. The proposed TNAR is composed by two complementary parts, the tangent adversarial regularization (TAR) and the normal adversarial regularization (NAR). In TAR, VAT is applied along the tangent space of the data manifold, aiming to enforce local invariance of the classifier on the manifold, while in NAR, VAT is performed on the normal space orthogonal to the tangent space, intending to impose robustness on the classifier against the noise causing the observed data deviating from the underlying data manifold. Demonstrated by experiments on both artificial and practical datasets, our proposed TAR and NAR complement with each other, and jointly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised learning.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Tangent-Normal,Adversarial,Regularization,for,Semi-Supervised,Learning"
222,Auto-Encoding Scene Graphs for Image Captioning,"We propose Scene Graph Auto-Encoder (SGAE) that incorporates the language inductive bias into the encoder-decoder image captioning framework for more human-like captions. Intuitively, we humans use the inductive bias to compose collocations and contextual inference in discourse. For example, when we see the relation ""person on bike"", it is natural to replace ""on"" with ""ride"" and infer ""person riding bike on a road"" even the ""road"" is not evident. Therefore, exploiting such bias as a language prior is expected to help the conventional encoder-decoder models less likely to overfit to the dataset bias and focus on reasoning. Specifically, we use the scene graph --- a directed graph (G) where an object node is connected by adjective nodes and relationship nodes --- to represent the complex structural layout of both image (I) and sentence (S). In the textual domain, we use SGAE to learn a dictionary (D) that helps to reconstruct sentences in the S -> G -> D -> S pipeline, where D encodes the desired language prior; in the vision-language domain, we use the shared D to guide the encoder-decoder in the I -> G -> D -> S pipeline. Thanks to the scene graph representation and shared dictionary, the inductive bias is transferred across domains in principle. We validate the effectiveness of SGAE on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark, e.g., our SGAE-based single-model achieves a new state-of-the-art 127.8 CIDEr-D on the Karpathy split, and a competitive 125.5 CIDEr-D (c40) on the official server even compared to other ensemble models.

223,"Fast, Diverse and Accurate Image Captioning Guided by Part-Of-Speech","Image captioning is an ambiguous problem, with many suitable captions for an image. To address ambiguity, beam search is the de facto method for sampling   multiple captions. However, beam search is  computationally expensive and known to produce generic captions.  To address this concern, some variational auto-encoder (VAE)  and generative adversarial net (GAN) based methods have been proposed. Though diverse, GAN and VAE  are less accurate. In this paper, we first predict a meaningful summary of the image,  then generate the caption based on that summary. We use part-of-speech as summaries, since our summary should drive caption generation. We achieve the trifecta:  (1) High accuracy for the diverse captions as evaluated by standard  captioning metrics and user studies; (2) Faster computation of diverse  captions compared to beam search and diverse beam search; and  (3) High diversity as evaluated by counting novel sentences,  distinct n-grams and mutual overlap (i.e., mBleu-4) scores.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fast,,Diverse,and,Accurate,Image,Captioning,Guided,by,Part-Of-Speech"
224,Attention Branch Network: Learning of Attention Mechanism for Visual Explanation,"Visual explanation enables humans to understand the decision making of deep convolutional neural network (CNN), but it is insufficient to contribute to improving CNN performance. In this paper, we focus on the attention map for visual explanation, which represents a high response value as the attention location in image recognition. This attention region significantly improves the performance of CNN by introducing an attention mechanism that focuses on a specific region in an image. In this work, we propose Attention Branch Network (ABN), which extends a response-based visual explanation model by introducing a branch structure with an attention mechanism. ABN can be applicable to several image recognition tasks by introducing a branch for the attention mechanism and is trainable for visual explanation and image recognition in an end-to-end manner.  We evaluate ABN on several image recognition tasks such as image classification, fine-grained recognition, and multiple facial attribute recognition. Experimental results indicate that ABN outperforms the baseline models on these image recognition tasks while generating an attention map for visual explanation.

225,Cascaded Projection: End-To-End Network Compression and Acceleration,"We propose a data-driven approach for deep convolutional neural network compression that achieves high accuracy with high throughput and low memory requirements. Current network compression methods either find a low-rank factorization of the features that requires more memory or select only a subset of features by pruning entire filter channels. We propose the Cascaded Projection (CaP) compression method that projects the output and input filter channels of successive layers to a unified low dimensional space based on a low-rank projection. We optimize the projection to minimize classification loss and the difference between the next layer's features in the compressed and uncompressed networks. To solve this non-convex optimization problem we propose a new optimization method of a proxy matrix using backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with geometric constraints. Our cascaded projection approach leads to improvements in all critical areas of network compression: high accuracy, low memory consumption, low parameter count and high processing speed. The proposed CaP method demonstrates state of the art results compressing VGG16 and ResNet networks with over 4X reduction in the number of computations and excellent performance in top-5 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset before and after fine-tuning.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cascaded,Projection:,End-To-End,Network,Compression,and,Acceleration"
226,DeepCaps: Going Deeper With Capsule Networks,"Capsule Network is a promising concept in deep learning, yet its true potential is not fully realized thus far, providing sub-par performance on several key benchmark datasets with complex data. Drawing intuition from the success achieved by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by going deeper, we introduce DeepCaps, a deep capsule network architecture which uses a novel 3D convolution based dynamic routing algorithm. With DeepCaps, we surpass the state-of-the-art capsule domain networks results on CIFAR10, SVHN and Fashion MNIST, while achieving a 68% reduction in the number of parameters. Further, we propose a class independent decoder network, which strengthens the use of reconstruction loss as a regularization term. This leads to an interesting property of the decoder, which allows us to identify and control the physical attributes of the images represented by the instantiation parameters.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DeepCaps:,Going,Deeper,With,Capsule,Networks"
227,FBNet: Hardware-Aware Efficient ConvNet Design via Differentiable Neural Architecture Search,"Designing accurate and efficient ConvNets for mobile devices is challenging because the design space is combinatorially large. Due to this, previous neural architecture search (NAS) methods are computationally expensive. ConvNet architecture optimality depends on factors such as input resolution and target devices. However, existing approaches are too resource demanding for case-by-case redesigns. Also, previous work focuses primarily on reducing FLOPs, but FLOP count does not always reflect actual latency. To address these, we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework that uses gradient-based methods to optimize ConvNet architectures, avoiding enumerating and training individual architectures separately as in previous methods. FBNets (Facebook-Berkeley-Nets), a family of models discovered by DNAS surpass state-of-the-art models both designed manually and generated automatically. FBNet-B achieves 74.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 295M FLOPs and 23.1 ms latency on a Samsung S8 phone, 2.4x smaller and 1.5x faster than MobileNetV2-1.3 with similar accuracy. Despite higher accuracy and lower latency than MnasNet, we estimate FBNet-B's search cost is 420x smaller than MnasNet's, at only 216 GPU-hours. Searched for different resolutions and channel sizes, FBNets achieve 1.5% to 6.4% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2. The smallest FBNet achieves 50.2% accuracy and 2.9 ms latency (345 frames per second) on a Samsung S8. Over a Samsung-optimized FBNet, the iPhone-X-optimized model achieves a 1.4x speedup on an iPhone X.

228,APDrawingGAN: Generating Artistic Portrait Drawings From Face Photos With Hierarchical GANs,"Significant progress has been made with image stylization using deep learning, especially with generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing methods fail to produce high quality artistic portrait drawings. Such drawings have a highly abstract style, containing a sparse set of continuous graphical elements such as lines, and so small artifacts are much more exposed than for painting styles. Moreover, artists tend to use different strategies to draw different facial features and the lines drawn are only loosely related to obvious image features. To address these challenges, we propose APDrawingGAN, a novel GAN based architecture that builds upon hierarchical generators and discriminators combining both a global network (for images as a whole) and local networks (for individual facial regions). This allows dedicated drawing strategies to be learned for different facial features. Since artists' drawings may not have lines perfectly aligned with image features, we develop a novel loss to measure similarity between generated and artists' drawings based on distance transforms, leading to improved strokes in portrait drawing. To train APDrawingGAN, we construct an artistic drawing dataset containing high-resolution portrait photos and corresponding professional artistic drawings. Extensive experiments, including a user study, show that APDrawingGAN produces significantly better artistic drawings than state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"APDrawingGAN:,Generating,Artistic,Portrait,Drawings,From,Face,Photos,With,Hierarchical,GANs"
229,Constrained Generative Adversarial Networks for Interactive Image Generation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have received a great deal of attention due in part to recent success in generating original, high-quality samples from visual domains. However, most current methods only allow for users to guide this image generation process through limited interactions. In this work we develop a novel GAN framework that allows humans to be ""in-the-loop"" of the image generation process. Our technique iteratively accepts relative constraints of the form ""Generate an image more like image A than image B"". After each constraint is given, the user is presented with new outputs from the GAN, informing the next round of feedback. This feedback is used to constrain the output of the GAN with respect to an underlying semantic space that can be designed to model a variety of different notions of similarity (e.g. classes, attributes, object relationships, color, etc.). In our experiments, we show that our GAN framework is able to generate images that are of comparable quality to equivalent unsupervised GANs while satisfying a large number of the constraints provided by users, effectively changing a GAN into one that allows users interactive control over image generation without sacrificing image quality.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Constrained,Generative,Adversarial,Networks,for,Interactive,Image,Generation"

Besides transferring rich texture styles, WarpGAN learns to automatically predict a set of control points that can warp the photo into a caricature, while preserving identity. We introduce an identity-preserving adversarial loss that aids the discriminator to distinguish between different subjects. Moreover, WarpGAN allows customization of the generated caricatures by controlling the exaggeration extent and the visual styles. Experimental results on a public domain dataset, WebCaricature, show that WarpGAN is capable of generating caricatures that not only preserve the identities but also outputs a diverse set of caricatures for each input photo. Five caricature experts suggest that caricatures generated by WarpGAN are visually similar to hand-drawn ones and only prominent facial features are exaggerated.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"WarpGAN:,Automatic,Caricature,Generation"
231,Explainability Methods for Graph Convolutional Neural Networks,"With the growing use of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) comes the need for explainability. In this paper, we introduce explainability methods for GCNNs. We develop the graph analogues of three prominent explainability methods for convolutional neural networks: contrastive gradient-based (CG) saliency maps, Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and Excitation Back-Propagation (EB) and their variants, gradient-weighted CAM (Grad-CAM) and contrastive EB (c-EB). We show a proof-of-concept of these methods on classification problems in two application domains: visual scene graphs and molecular graphs. To compare the methods, we identify three desirable properties of explanations: (1) their importance to classification, as measured by the impact of occlusions, (2) their contrastivity with respect to different classes, and (3) their sparseness on a graph. We call the corresponding quantitative metrics fidelity, contrastivity, and sparsity and evaluate them for each method. Lastly, we analyze the salient subgraphs obtained from explanations and report frequently occurring patterns.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Explainability,Methods,for,Graph,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"
232,A Generative Adversarial Density Estimator,"Density estimation is a challenging unsupervised learning problem. Current maximum likelihood approaches for density estimation are either restrictive or incapable of producing high-quality samples. On the other hand, likelihood-free models such as generative adversarial networks, produce sharp samples without a density model. The lack of a density estimate limits the applications to which the sampled data can be put, however. We propose a Generative Adversarial Density Estimator, a density estimation approach that bridges the gap between the two. Allowing for a prior on the parameters of the model, we extend our density estimator to a Bayesian model where we can leverage the predictive variance to measure our confidence in the likelihood. Our experiments on challenging applications such as visual dialog where the density and the confidence in predictions are crucial shows the effectiveness of our approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Generative,Adversarial,Density,Estimator"
233,SoDeep: A Sorting Deep Net to Learn Ranking Loss Surrogates,"Several tasks in machine learning are evaluated using non-differentiable metrics such as mean average precision or Spearman correlation. However, their non-differentiability prevents from using them as objective functions in a learning framework. Surrogate and relaxation methods exist but tend to be specific to a given metric.   In the present work, we introduce a new method to learn approximations of such non-differentiable objective functions. Our approach is based on a deep architecture that approximates the sorting of arbitrary sets of scores. It is trained virtually for free using synthetic data. This sorting deep (SoDeep) net can then be combined in a plug-and-play manner with existing deep architectures. We demonstrate the interest of our approach in three different tasks that require ranking: Cross-modal text-image retrieval, multi-label image classification and visual memorability ranking. Our approach yields very competitive results on these three tasks, which validates the merit and the flexibility of SoDeep as a proxy for sorting operation in ranking-based losses.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SoDeep:,A,Sorting,Deep,Net,to,Learn,Ranking,Loss,Surrogates"
234,High-Quality Face Capture Using Anatomical Muscles,"Muscle-based systems have the potential to provide both anatomical accuracy and semantic interpretability as compared to blendshape models; however, a lack of expressivity and differentiability has limited their impact. Thus, we propose modifying a recently developed rather expressive muscle-based system in order to make it fully-differentiable; in fact, our proposed modifications allow this physically robust and anatomically accurate muscle model to conveniently be driven by an underlying blendshape basis. Our formulation is intuitive, natural, as well as monolithically and fully coupled such that one can differentiate the model from end to end, which makes it viable for both optimization and learning-based approaches for a variety of applications. We illustrate this with a number of examples including both shape matching of three-dimensional geometry as as well as the automatic determination of a three-dimensional facial pose from a single two-dimensional RGB image without using markers or depth information.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"High-Quality,Face,Capture,Using,Anatomical,Muscles"
235,FML: Face Model Learning From Videos,"Monocular image-based 3D reconstruction of faces is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Since image data is a 2D projection of a 3D face, the resulting depth ambiguity makes the problem ill-posed. Most existing methods rely on data-driven priors that are built from limited 3D face scans. In contrast, we propose multi-frame video-based self-supervised training of a deep network that (i) learns a face identity model both in shape and appearance while (ii) jointly learning to reconstruct 3D faces. Our face model is learned using only corpora of in-the-wild video clips collected from the Internet. This virtually endless source of training data enables learning of a highly general 3D face model. In order to achieve this, we propose a novel multi-frame consistency loss that ensures consistent shape and appearance across multiple frames of a subject's face, thus minimizing depth ambiguity. At test time we can use an arbitrary number of frames, so that we can perform both monocular as well as multi-frame reconstruction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"FML:,Face,Model,Learning,From,Videos"
236,AdaCos: Adaptively Scaling Cosine Logits for Effectively Learning Deep Face Representations,"The cosine-based softmax losses and their variants achieve great success in deep learning based face recognition. However, hyperparameter settings in these losses have significant influences on the optimization path as well as the final recognition performance. Manually tuning those hyperparameters heavily relies on user experience and requires many training tricks.   In this paper, we investigate in depth the effects of two important hyperparameters of cosine-based softmax losses, the scale parameter and angular margin parameter, by analyzing how they modulate the predicted classification  probability. Based on these analysis, we propose a novel cosine-based softmax loss, AdaCos, which is hyperparameter-free and leverages an adaptive scale parameter to automatically strengthen the training supervisions during the training process. We apply the proposed AdaCos loss to large-scale face verification and identification datasets, including LFW, MegaFace, and IJB-C 1:1 Verification. Our results show that training deep neural networks with the AdaCos loss is stable and able to achieve high face recognition accuracy. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art softmax losses on all the three datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"AdaCos:,Adaptively,Scaling,Cosine,Logits,for,Effectively,Learning,Deep,Face,Representations"
237,3D Hand Shape and Pose Estimation From a Single RGB Image,"This work addresses a novel and challenging problem of estimating the full 3D hand shape and pose from a single RGB image. Most current methods in 3D hand analysis from monocular RGB images only focus on estimating the 3D locations of hand keypoints, which cannot fully express the 3D shape of hand. In contrast, we propose a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Graph CNN) based method to reconstruct a full 3D mesh of hand surface that contains richer information of both 3D hand shape and pose. To train networks with full supervision, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset containing both ground truth 3D meshes and 3D poses. When fine-tuning the networks on real-world datasets without 3D ground truth, we propose a weakly-supervised approach by leveraging the depth map as a weak supervision in training. Through extensive evaluations on our proposed new datasets and two public datasets, we show that our proposed method can produce accurate and reasonable 3D hand mesh, and can achieve superior 3D hand pose estimation accuracy when compared with state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"3D,Hand,Shape,and,Pose,Estimation,From,a,Single,RGB,Image"

Our network consists of the concatenation of a deep convolutional encoder, and a fixed model-based decoder. Given an input image, and optionally 2D joint detections obtained from an independent CNN, the encoder predicts a set of hand and view parameters. The decoder has two components: A pre-computed articulated mesh deformation hand model that generates a 3D mesh from the hand parameters, and a re-projection module controlled by the view parameters that projects the generated hand into the image domain. We show that using the shape and pose prior knowledge encoded in the hand model within a deep learning framework yields state-of-the-art performance in 3D pose prediction from images on standard benchmarks, and produces geometrically valid and plausible 3D reconstructions. Additionally, we show that training with weak supervision in the form of 2D joint annotations on datasets of images in the wild, in conjunction with full supervision in the form of 3D joint annotations on limited available datasets allows for good generalization to 3D shape and pose predictions on images in the wild.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"3D,Hand,Shape,and,Pose,From,Images,in,the,Wild"

By approximating the hand surface with a set of spheres, we design a differentiable hand renderer to align estimates by comparing the rendered and input depth maps. In addition, we place a set of priors including a data-driven term to further regulate the estimate's kinematic feasibility. Our method makes highly accurate estimates comparable to current supervised methods which require large amounts of labelled training samples, thereby advancing state-of-the-art in unsupervised learning for hand pose estimation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Supervised,3D,Hand,Pose,Estimation,Through,Training,by,Fitting"

However, few previous methods explored the problem of pose estimation in crowded scenes while it remains challenging and inevitable in many scenarios. Moreover, current benchmarks cannot provide an appropriate evaluation for such cases. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method to tackle the problem of pose estimation in the crowd and a new dataset to better evaluate algorithms. Our model consists of two key components: joint-candidate single person pose estimation (SPPE) and global maximum joints association. With multi-peak prediction for each joint and global association using the graph model, our method is robust to inevitable interference in crowded scenes and very efficient in inference.  The proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on CrowdPose dataset by 5.2 mAP and results on MSCOCO dataset demonstrate the generalization ability of our method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CrowdPose:,Efficient,Crowded,Scenes,Pose,Estimation,and,a,New,Benchmark"

This research direction is essential to make a machine that genuinely communicates with humans, which we call Social Artificial Intelligence. We first formulate the ""social signal prediction"" problem as a way to model the dynamics of social signals exchanged among interacting individuals in a data-driven way. We then present a new 3D motion capture dataset to explore this problem, where the broad spectrum of social signals (3D body, face, and hand motions) are captured in a triadic social interaction scenario.

We first introduce a part-based model for 3D model parameter regression that allows our method to operate in-the-wild, gracefully handling severe occlusions and large pose variation. We further train a multi-task network comprising 2D, 3D and Dense Pose estimation to drive the 3D reconstruction task. For this we introduce an iterative refinement method that aligns the model-based 3D estimates of 2D/3D joint positions and DensePose with their image-based counterparts delivered by CNNs, achieving both model-based, global consistency and high spatial accuracy thanks to the bottom-up CNN processing. We validate our contributions on challenging benchmarks, showing that our method allows us to get both accurate joint and 3D surface estimates while operating at more than 10fps in-the-wild.

243,Weakly-Supervised Discovery of Geometry-Aware Representation for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Recent studies have shown remarkable advances in 3D human pose estimation from monocular images, with the help of large-scale in-door 3D datasets and sophisticated network architectures. However, the generalizability to different environments remains an elusive goal. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware 3D representation for the human pose to address this limitation by using multiple views in a simple auto-encoder model at the training stage and only 2D keypoint information as supervision. A view synthesis framework is proposed to learn the shared 3D representation between viewpoints with synthe- sizing the human pose from one viewpoint to the other one. Instead of performing a direct transfer in the raw image- level, we propose a skeleton-based encoder-decoder mechanism to distil only pose-related representation in the latent space. A learning-based representation consistency constraint is further introduced to facilitate the robustness of latent 3D representation. Since the learnt representation encodes 3D geometry information, mapping it to 3D pose will be much easier than conventional frameworks that use an image or 2D coordinates as the input of 3D pose estimator. We demonstrate our approach on the task of 3D human pose estimation. Comprehensive experiments on three popular benchmarks show that our model can significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods with simply injecting the representation as a robust 3D prior.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly-Supervised,Discovery,of,Geometry-Aware,Representation,for,3D,Human,Pose,Estimation"
244,In the Wild Human Pose Estimation Using Explicit 2D Features and Intermediate 3D Representations,"Convolutional Neural Network based approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation usually require a large amount of training images with 3D pose annotations. While it is feasible to provide 2D joint annotations for large corpora of in-the-wild images with humans, providing accurate 3D annotations to such in-the-wild corpora is hardly feasible in practice. Most existing 3D labelled data sets are either synthetically created or feature in-studio images. 3D pose estimation algorithms trained on such data often have limited ability to generalize to real world scene diversity. We therefore propose a new deep learning based method for monocular 3D human pose estimation that shows high accuracy and generalizes better to in-the-wild scenes. It has a network architecture that comprises a new disentangled hidden space encoding of explicit 2D and 3D features, and uses supervision by a new learned projection model from predicted 3D pose. Our algorithm can be jointly trained on image data with 3D labels and image data with only 2D labels.

245,Slim DensePose: Thrifty Learning From Sparse Annotations and Motion Cues,"DensePose supersedes traditional landmark detectors by densely mapping image pixels to body surface coordinates. This power, however, comes at a greatly increased annotation cost, as supervising the model requires to manually label hundreds of points per pose instance. In this work, we thus seek methods to significantly slim down the DensePose annotations, proposing more efficient data collection strategies. In particular, we demonstrate that if annotations are collected in video frames, their efficacy can be multiplied for free by using motion cues. To explore this idea, we introduce DensePose-Track, a dataset of videos where selected frames are annotated in the traditional DensePose manner. Then, building on geometric properties of the DensePose mapping, we use the video dynamic to propagate ground-truth annotations in time as well as to learn from Siamese equivariance constraints. Having performed exhaustive empirical evaluation of various data annotation and learning strategies, we demonstrate that doing so can deliver significantly improved pose estimation results over strong baselines. However, despite what is suggested by some recent works, we show that merely synthesizing motion patterns by applying geometric transformations to isolated frames is significantly less effective, and that motion cues help much more when they are extracted from videos.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Slim,DensePose:,Thrifty,Learning,From,Sparse,Annotations,and,Motion,Cues"

Inspired by the fact that facial actions are the movements of facial muscles, we depict the movements as the transformation between two face images in different frames and use it as the self-supervisory signal to learn the representations. However, under the uncontrolled condition, the transformation is caused by both facial actions and head motions. To remove the influence by head motions, we propose a Twin-Cycle Autoencoder (TCAE) that can disentangle the facial action related movements and the head motion related ones. Specifically, TCAE is trained to respectively change the facial actions and head poses of the source face to those of the target face. Our experiments validate TCAE's capability of decoupling the movements. Experimental results also demonstrate that the learned representation is discriminative for AU detection, where TCAE outperforms or is comparable with the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and supervised AU detection methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Supervised,Representation,Learning,From,Videos,for,Facial,Action,Unit,Detection"

In this context, we identify an interesting question that has previously not received research attention: is it possible to combine two or more 3DMMs that (a) are built using different templates that perhaps only partly overlap, (b) have different representation capabilities and (c) are built from different datasets that may not be publicly-available? In answering this question, we make two contributions. First, we propose two methods for solving this problem: i. use a regressor to complete missing parts of one model using the other, ii. use the Gaussian Process framework to blend covariance matrices from multiple models. Second, as an example application of our approach, we build a new head and face model that combines the variability and facial detail of the LSFM with the full head modelling of the LYHM. The resulting combined model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing head models by a large margin. Finally, as an application experiment, we reconstruct full head representations from single, unconstrained images by utilizing our proposed large-scale model in conjunction with the Face-Warehouse blendshapes for handling expressions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Combining,3D,Morphable,Models:,A,Large,Scale,Face-And-Head,Model"
248,Boosting Local Shape Matching for Dense 3D Face Correspondence,"Dense 3D face correspondence is a fundamental and challenging issue in the literature of 3D face analysis. Correspondence between two 3D faces can be viewed as a non-rigid registration problem that one deforms into the other, which is commonly guided by a few facial landmarks in many existing works. However, the current works seldom consider the problem of incoherent deformation caused by landmarks. In this paper, we explicitly formulate the deformation as locally rigid motions guided by some seed points, and the formulated deformation satisfies coherent local motions everywhere on a face. The seed points are initialized by a few landmarks, and are then augmented to boost shape matching between the template and the target face step by step, to finally achieve dense correspondence. In each step, we employ a hierarchical scheme for local shape registration, together with a Gaussian reweighting strategy for accurate matching of local features around the seed points. In our experiments, we evaluate the proposed method extensively on several datasets, including two publicly available ones: FRGC v2.0 and BU-3DFE. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate feature correspondence, coherent local shape motion, and compact data representation. These merits actually settle some important issues for practical applications, such as expressions, noise, and partial data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Boosting,Local,Shape,Matching,for,Dense,3D,Face,Correspondence"

Images, however, only show the superposition of different variable factors such as appearance or shape. Therefore, learning to disentangle and represent these different characteristics poses a great challenge, especially in the unsupervised case. Moreover, large object articulation calls for a flexible part-based model. We present an unsupervised approach for disentangling appearance and shape by learning parts consistently over all instances of a category. Our model for learning an object representation is trained by simultaneously exploiting invariance and equivariance constraints between synthetically transformed images. Since no part annotation or prior information on an object class is required, the approach is applicable to arbitrary classes. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of object categories and diverse tasks including pose prediction, disentangled image synthesis, and video-to-video translation. The approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on unsupervised keypoint prediction and compares favorably even against supervised approaches on the task of shape and appearance transfer.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Part-Based,Disentangling,of,Object,Shape,and,Appearance"

Given an image or a monocular video, our method reconstructs the motion from body, face, and fingers represented by a 3D deformable mesh model. We use an efficient representation called 3D Part Orientation Fields (POFs), to encode the 3D orientations of all body parts in the common 2D image space. POFs are predicted by a Fully Convolutional Network, along with the joint confidence maps. To train our network, we collect a new 3D human motion dataset capturing diverse total body motion of 40 subjects in a multiview system. We leverage a 3D deformable human model to reconstruct total body pose from the CNN outputs with the aid of the pose and shape prior in the model. We also present a texture-based tracking method to obtain temporally coherent motion capture output. We perform thorough quantitative evaluations including comparison with the existing body-specific and hand-specific methods, and performance analysis on camera viewpoint and human pose changes.

251,"Expressive Body Capture: 3D Hands, Face, and Body From a Single Image","To facilitate the analysis of human actions, interactions and emotions, we compute a 3D model of human body pose, hand pose, and facial expression from a single monocular image. To achieve this, we use thousands of 3D scans to train a new, unified, 3D model of the human body, SMPL-X, that extends SMPL with fully articulated hands and an expressive face. Learning to regress the parameters of SMPL-X directly from images is challenging without paired images and 3D ground truth. Consequently, we follow the approach of SMPLify, which estimates 2D features and then optimizes model parameters to fit the features. We improve on SMPLify in several significant ways: (1) we detect 2D features corresponding to the face, hands, and feet and fit the full SMPL-X model to these; (2) we train a new neural network pose prior using a large MoCap dataset; (3) we define a new interpenetration penalty that is both fast and accurate; (4) we automatically detect gender and the appropriate body models (male, female, or neutral); (5) our PyTorch implementation achieves a speedup of more than 8x over Chumpy. We use the new method, SMPLify-X, to fit SMPL-X to both controlled images and images in the wild. We evaluate 3D accuracy on a new curated dataset comprising 100 images with pseudo ground-truth. This is a step towards automatic expressive human capture from monocular RGB data.

252,Neural RGB(r)D Sensing: Depth and Uncertainty From a Video Camera,"Depth sensing is crucial for 3D reconstruction and scene understanding. Active depth sensors provide dense metric measurements, but often suffer from limitations such as restricted operating ranges, low spatial resolution, sensor interference, and high power consumption. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) method to estimate per-pixel depth and its uncertainty continuously from a monocular video stream, with the goal of effectively turning an RGB camera into an RGB-D camera. Unlike prior DL-based methods, we estimate a depth probability distribution for each pixel rather than a single depth value, leading to an estimate of a 3D depth probability volume for each input frame. These depth probability volumes are accumulated over time under a Bayesian filtering framework as more incoming frames are processed sequentially, which effectively reduces depth uncertainty and improves accuracy, robustness, and temporal stability. Compared to prior work, the proposed approach achieves more accurate and stable results, and generalizes better to new datasets. Experimental results also show the output of our approach can be directly fed into classical RGB-D based 3D scanning methods for 3D scene reconstruction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Neural,RGB(r)D,Sensing:,Depth,and,Uncertainty,From,a,Video,Camera"
253,DAVANet: Stereo Deblurring With View Aggregation,"Nowadays stereo cameras are more commonly adopted in emerging devices such as dual-lens smartphones and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, they also suffer from blurry images in dynamic scenes which leads to visual discomfort and hampers further image processing. Previous works have succeeded in monocular deblurring, yet there are few studies on deblurring for stereoscopic images. By exploiting the two-view nature of stereo images, we propose a novel stereo image deblurring network with Depth Awareness and View Aggregation, named DAVANet. In our proposed network, 3D scene cues from the depth and varying information from two views are incorporated, which help to remove complex spatially-varying blur in dynamic scenes. Specifically, with our proposed fusion network, we integrate the bidirectional disparities estimation and deblurring into a unified framework. Moreover, we present a large-scale multi-scene dataset for stereo deblurring, containing 20,637 blurry-sharp stereo image pairs from 135 diverse sequences and their corresponding bidirectional disparities. The experimental results on our dataset demonstrate that DAVANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and model size.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DAVANet:,Stereo,Deblurring,With,View,Aggregation"
254,DVC: An End-To-End Deep Video Compression Framework,"Conventional video compression approaches use the predictive coding architecture and encode the corresponding motion information and residual information. In this paper, taking advantage of both classical architecture in the conventional video compression method and the powerful non-linear representation ability of neural networks, we propose the first end-to-end video compression deep model that jointly optimizes all the components for video compression. Specifically, learning based optical flow estimation is utilized to obtain the motion information and reconstruct the current frames. Then we employ two auto-encoder style neural networks to compress the corresponding motion and residual information. All the modules are jointly learned through a single loss function, in which they collaborate with each other by considering the trade-off between reducing the number of compression bits and improving quality of the decoded video. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform the widely used video coding standard H.264 in terms of PSNR and be even on par with the latest standard H.265 in terms of MS-SSIM.

255,SOSNet: Second Order Similarity Regularization for Local Descriptor Learning,"Despite the fact that Second Order Similarity (SOS) has been used with significant success in tasks such as graph matching and clustering, it has not been exploited for learning local descriptors. In this work, we explore the potential of \sos in the field of descriptor learning by building upon the intuition that a positive pair of matching points should exhibit similar distances with respect to other points in the embedding space.  Thus, we propose a novel regularization term, named Second Order Similarity Regularization (SOSR), that follows this principle.  By incorporating SOSR into training, our learned descriptor achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging benchmarks containing distinct tasks ranging from local patch retrieval to structure from motion.  Furthermore, by designing a von Mises-Fischer distribution based evaluation method, we link the utilization of the descriptor space to the matching performance, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed SOSR. Extensive experimental results, empirical evidence, and in-depth analysis are provided, indicating that SOSR can significantly boost the matching performance of the learned descriptor.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SOSNet:,Second,Order,Similarity,Regularization,for,Local,Descriptor,Learning"
256,"""Double-DIP"": Unsupervised Image Decomposition via Coupled Deep-Image-Priors","Many seemingly unrelated computer vision tasks can be viewed as a special case of image decomposition into separate layers.  For example, image segmentation (separation into foreground and background layers); transparent layer separation (into reflection and transmission layers); Image dehazing (separation into a clear image and a haze map), and more. In this paper we propose a unified framework for unsupervised layer decomposition of a single image, based on coupled ""Deep-image-Prior"" (DIP) networks.  It was shown [Ulyanov et al] that the structure of a single DIP generator network is sufficient to capture the low-level statistics of a single image. We show that coupling multiple such DIPs provides a powerful tool for decomposing images into their basic components, for a wide variety of applications. This capability stems from the fact that the internal statistics of a mixture of layers is more complex than the statistics of each of its individual components. We show the power of this approach for Image-Dehazing, Fg/Bg Segmentation, Watermark-Removal, Transparency Separation in images and video, and more. These capabilities are achieved in a totally unsupervised way, with no training examples other than the input image/video itself.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"""Double-DIP"":,Unsupervised,Image,Decomposition,via,Coupled,Deep-Image-Priors"
257,Unprocessing Images for Learned Raw Denoising,"Machine learning techniques work best when the data used for training resembles the data used for evaluation. This holds true for learned single-image denoising algorithms, which are applied to real raw camera sensor readings but, due to practical constraints, are often trained on synthetic image data. Though it is understood that generalizing from synthetic to real images requires careful consideration of the noise properties of camera sensors, the other aspects of an image processing pipeline (such as gain, color correction, and tone mapping) are often overlooked, despite their significant effect on how raw measurements are transformed into finished images. To address this, we present a technique to ""unprocess"" images by inverting each step of an image processing pipeline, thereby allowing us to synthesize realistic raw sensor measurements from commonly available Internet photos. We additionally model the relevant components of an image processing pipeline when evaluating our loss function, which allows training to be aware of all relevant photometric processing that will occur after denoising. By unprocessing and processing training data and model outputs in this way, we are able to train a simple convolutional neural network that has 14%-38% lower error rates and is 9x-18x faster than the previous state of the art on the Darmstadt Noise Dataset, and generalizes to sensors outside of that dataset as well.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unprocessing,Images,for,Learned,Raw,Denoising"
258,Residual Networks for Light Field Image Super-Resolution,"Light field cameras are considered to have many potential applications since angular and spatial information is captured simultaneously. However, the limited spatial resolution has brought lots of difficulties in developing related applications and becomes the main bottleneck of light field cameras. In this paper, a learning-based method using residual convolutional networks is proposed to reconstruct light fields with higher spatial resolution. The view images in one light field are first grouped into different image stacks with consistent sub-pixel offsets and fed into different network branches to implicitly learn inherent corresponding relations. The residual information in different spatial directions is then calculated from each branch and further integrated to supplement high-frequency details for the view image.  Finally, a flexible solution is proposed to super-resolve entire light field images with various angular resolutions. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in both visual and numerical evaluations. Furthermore, the proposed method shows good performances in preserving the inherent epipolar property in light field images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Residual,Networks,for,Light,Field,Image,Super-Resolution"
259,Modulating Image Restoration With Continual Levels via Adaptive Feature Modification Layers,"In image restoration tasks, like denoising and superresolution, continual modulation of restoration levels is of great importance for real-world applications, but has failed most of existing deep learning based image restoration methods. Learning from discrete and fixed restoration levels, deep models cannot be easily generalized to data of continuous and unseen levels. This topic is rarely touched in literature, due to the difficulty of modulating well-trained models with certain hyper-parameters. We make a step forward by proposing a unified CNN framework that consists of little additional parameters than a single-level model yet could handle arbitrary restoration levels between a start and an end level. The additional module, namely AdaFM layer, performs channel-wise feature modification, and can adapt a model to another restoration level with high accuracy. By simply tweaking an interpolation coefficient, the intermediate model - AdaFM-Net could generate smooth and continuous restoration effects without artifacts. Extensive experiments on three image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of both model training and modulation testing. Besides, we carefully investigate the properties of AdaFM layers, providing a detailed guidance on the usage of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Modulating,Image,Restoration,With,Continual,Levels,via,Adaptive,Feature,Modification,Layers"
260,Second-Order Attention Network for Single Image Super-Resolution,"Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely explored in single image super-resolution (SISR) and obtained remarkable performance. However, most of the existing CNN-based SISR methods mainly focus on wider or deeper architecture design, neglecting to explore the feature correlations of intermediate layers, hence hindering the representational power of CNNs. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a second-order attention network (SAN) for more powerful feature expression and feature correlation learning. Specifically, a novel train- able second-order channel attention (SOCA) module is developed to adaptively rescale the channel-wise features by using second-order feature statistics for more discriminative representations. Furthermore, we present a non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) structure, which not only incorporates non-local operations to capture long-distance spatial contextual information, but also contains repeated local-source residual attention groups (LSRAG) to learn increasingly abstract feature representations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our SAN network over state-of-the-art SISR methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Second-Order,Attention,Network,for,Single,Image,Super-Resolution"
261,Devil Is in the Edges: Learning Semantic Boundaries From Noisy Annotations,"We tackle the problem of semantic boundary prediction, which aims to identify pixels that belong to object(class) boundaries. We notice that relevant datasets consist of a significant level of label noise, reflecting the fact that precise annotations are laborious to get and thus annotators trade-off quality with efficiency. We aim to learn sharp and precise semantic boundaries by explicitly reasoning about annotation noise during training. We propose a simple new layer and loss that can be used with existing learning-based boundary detectors. Our layer/loss enforces the detector to predict a maximum response along the normal direction at an edge, while also regularizing its direction. We further reason about true object boundaries during training using a level set formulation, which allows the network to learn from misaligned labels in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments show that we improve over the CASENet backbone network by more than 4% in terms of MF(ODS) and 18.61% in terms of AP, outperforming all current state-of-the-art methods including those that deal with alignment. Furthermore, we show that our learned network can be used to significantly improve coarse segmentation labels, lending itself as an efficient way to label new data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Devil,Is,in,the,Edges:,Learning,Semantic,Boundaries,From,Noisy,Annotations"
262,Path-Invariant Map Networks,"Optimizing a network of maps among a collection of objects/domains (or map synchronization) is a central problem across computer vision and many other relevant fields. Compared to optimizing pairwise maps in isolation, the benefit of map synchronization is that there are natural constraints among a map network that can improve the quality of individual maps. While such self-supervision constraints are well-understood for undirected map networks (e.g., the cycle-consistency constraint), they are under-explored for directed map networks, which naturally arise when maps are given by parametric maps (e.g., a feed-forward neural network). In this paper, we study a natural self-supervision constraint for directed map networks called path-invariance, which enforces that composite maps along different paths between a fixed pair of source and target domains are identical. We introduce path-invariance bases for efficient encoding of the path-invariance constraint and present an algorithm that outputs a path-variance basis with polynomial time and space complexities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation on optimizing object correspondences, estimating dense image maps via neural networks, and 3D scene segmentation via map networks of diverse 3D representations. In particular, our approach only requires 8% labeled data from ScanNet to achieve the same performance as training a single 3D semantic segmentation network with 30% to 100% labeled data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Path-Invariant,Map,Networks"
263,FilterReg: Robust and Efficient Probabilistic Point-Set Registration Using Gaussian Filter and Twist Parameterization,"Probabilistic point-set registration methods have been gaining more attention for their robustness to noise, outliers and occlusions. However, these methods tend to be much slower than the popular iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms, which severely limits their usability. In this paper, we contribute a novel probabilistic registration method that achieves state-of-the-art robustness as well as substantially faster computational performance than modern ICP implementations. This is achieved using a rigorous yet computationally-efficient probabilistic formulation. Point-set registration is cast as a maximum likelihood estimation and solved using the EM algorithm. We show that with a simple augmentation, the E step can be formulated as a filtering problem, allowing us to leverage advances in efficient Gaussian filtering methods. We also propose a customized permutohedral filter to improve its performance while retaining sufficient accuracy for our task. Additionally, we present a simple and efficient twist parameterization that generalizes our method to the registration of articulated and deformable objects. For articulated objects, the complexity of our method is almost independent of the Degrees Of Freedom (DOFs), which makes it highly efficient even for high DOF systems. The results demonstrate the proposed method consistently outperforms many competitive baselines on a variety of registration tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"FilterReg:,Robust,and,Efficient,Probabilistic,Point-Set,Registration,Using,Gaussian,Filter,and,Twist,Parameterization"

To this end, we first introduce the very recently developed Riemannian geometry of the Birkhoff Polytope. Next, we introduce a new probabilistic synchronization model in the form of a Markov Random Field (MRF). Finally, based on the first order retraction operators, we formulate our problem as simulating a stochastic differential equation and devise new integrators. We show on both synthetic and real datasets that we achieve high quality multi-graph matching results with faster convergence and reliable confidence/uncertainty estimates.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Probabilistic,Permutation,Synchronization,Using,the,Riemannian,Structure,of,the,Birkhoff,Polytope"

We approach the relaxation and convexification of such vectorial variational problems via a lifting to the space of currents. To that end, we recall that functionals with polyconvex Lagrangians can be reparametrized as convex one-homogeneous functionals on the graph of the function. This leads to an equivalent shape optimization problem over oriented surfaces in the product space of domain and codomain. A convex formulation is then obtained by relaxing the search space from oriented surfaces to more general currents. We propose a discretization of the resulting infinite-dimensional optimization problem using Whitney forms, which also generalizes recent ""sublabel-accurate"" multilabeling approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Lifting,Vectorial,Variational,Problems:,A,Natural,Formulation,Based,on,Geometric,Measure,Theory,and,Discrete,Exterior,Calculus"
266,A Sufficient Condition for Convergences of Adam and RMSProp,"Adam and RMSProp are two of the most influential adaptive stochastic algorithms for training deep neural networks, which have been pointed out to be divergent even in the convex setting via a few simple counterexamples. Many attempts, such as decreasing an adaptive learning rate, adopting a big batch size, incorporating a temporal decorrelation technique, seeking an analogous surrogate, etc., have been tried to promote Adam/RMSProp-type algorithms to converge. In contrast with existing approaches, we introduce an alternative easy-to-check sufficient condition, which merely depends on the parameters of the base learning rate and combinations of historical second-order moments, to guarantee the global convergence of generic Adam/RMSProp for solving large-scale non-convex stochastic optimization. Moreover, we show that the convergences of several variants of Adam, such as AdamNC, AdaEMA, etc., can be directly implied via the proposed sufficient condition in the non-convex setting. In addition, we illustrate that Adam is essentially a specifically weighted AdaGrad with exponential moving average momentum, which provides a novel perspective for understanding Adam and RMSProp. This observation coupled with this sufficient condition gives much deeper interpretations on their divergences. At last, we validate the sufficient condition by applying Adam and RMSProp to tackle a certain counterexample and train deep neural networks. Numerical results are exactly in accord with our theoretical analysis.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Sufficient,Condition,for,Convergences,of,Adam,and,RMSProp"
267,Guaranteed Matrix Completion Under Multiple Linear Transformations,"Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) is a classical model in both computer vision (CV) and machine learning, and has been successfully applied to various real applications. In the recent CV tasks, the completion is usually employed on the variants of data, such as ""non-local"" or filtered, rather than their original forms. This fact makes that the theoretical analysis of the conventional LRMC is no longer suitable in these applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a more general framework for LRMC, in which the linear transformations of the data are taken into account. We rigorously prove the identifiability of the proposed model and show an upper bound of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we derive an efficient completion algorithm by using augmented Lagrangian multipliers and the sketching trick. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to the classical image inpainting problem and achieve the state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Guaranteed,Matrix,Completion,Under,Multiple,Linear,Transformations"

270,Pixel-Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutions are the fundamental building blocks of CNNs. The fact that their weights are spatially shared is one of the main reasons for their widespread use, but it is also a major limitation, as it makes convolutions content-agnostic. We propose a pixel-adaptive convolution (PAC) operation, a simple yet effective modification of standard convolutions, in which the filter weights are multiplied with a spatially varying kernel that depends on learnable, local pixel features. PAC is a generalization of several popular filtering techniques and thus can be used for a wide range of use cases. Specifically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when PAC is used for deep joint image upsampling. PAC also offers an effective alternative to fully-connected CRF (Full-CRF), called PAC-CRF, which performs competitively compared to Full-CRF, while being considerably faster. In addition, we also demonstrate that PAC can be used as a drop-in replacement for convolution layers in pre-trained networks, resulting in consistent performance improvements.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pixel-Adaptive,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"
271,Single-Frame Regularization for Temporally Stable CNNs,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can model complicated non-linear relations between images. However, they are notoriously sensitive to small changes in the input. Most CNNs trained to describe image-to-image mappings generate temporally unstable results when applied to video sequences, leading to flickering artifacts and other inconsistencies over time. In order to use CNNs for video material, previous methods have relied on estimating dense frame-to-frame motion information (optical flow) in the training and/or the inference phase, or by exploring recurrent learning structures. We take a different approach to the problem, posing temporal stability as a regularization of the cost function. The regularization is formulated to account for different types of motion that can occur between frames, so that temporally stable CNNs can be trained without the need for video material or expensive motion estimation. The training can be performed as a fine-tuning operation, without architectural modifications of the CNN. Our evaluation shows that the training strategy leads to large improvements in temporal smoothness. Moreover, for small datasets the regularization can help in boosting the generalization performance to a much larger extent than what is possible with naive augmentation strategies.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Single-Frame,Regularization,for,Temporally,Stable,CNNs"

To this end, we need systems that can understand social relationships in diverse social contexts. Inferring the social context in a given visual scene not only involves recognizing objects, but also demands a more in-depth understanding of the relationships and attributes of the people involved. To achieve this, one computational approach for representing human relationships and attributes is to use an explicit knowledge graph, which allows for high-level reasoning. We introduce a novel end-to-end-trainable neural network that is capable of generating a Social Relationship Graph - a structured, unified representation of social relationships and attributes - from a given input image. Our Social Relationship Graph Generation Network (SRG-GN) is the first to use memory cells like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to iteratively update the social relationship states in a graph using scene and attribute context. The neural network exploits the recurrent connections among the GRUs to implement message passing between nodes and edges in the graph, and results in significant improvement over previous methods for social relationship recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"An,End-To-End,Network,for,Generating,Social,Relationship,Graphs"

Designing DNNs that can meet a stringent energy budget is becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes ECC, a framework that compresses DNNs to meet a given energy constraint while minimizing accuracy loss. The key idea of ECC is to model the DNN energy consumption via a novel bilinear regression function. The energy estimate model allows us to formulate DNN compression as a constrained optimization that minimizes the DNN loss function over the energy constraint. The optimization problem, however, has nontrivial constraints. Therefore, existing deep learning solvers do not apply directly. We propose an optimization algorithm that combines the essence of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework with gradient-based learning algorithms. The algorithm decomposes the original constrained optimization into several subproblems that are solved iteratively and efficiently. ECC is also portable across different hardware platforms without requiring hardware knowledge. Experiments show that ECC achieves higher accuracy under the same or lower energy budget compared to state-of-the-art resource-constrained DNN compression techniques.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ECC:,Platform-Independent,Energy-Constrained,Deep,Neural,Network,Compression,via,a,Bilinear,Regression,Model"

We experimentally demonstrate that a highly quantized version of the original network is sufficient in predicting the output sparsity accurately, and verify that leveraging such sparsity in inference incurs negligible accuracy drop compared with the original network. To accelerate inference, for each convolution layer our approach first obtains a binary sparsity mask of the output feature maps by running inference on a quantized version of the original network layer, and then conducts a full-precision sparse convolution to find out the precise values of the non-zero outputs. Compared with existing work, our approach avoids the overhead of training additional auxiliary networks, while is still applicable to general CNN networks without being limited to certain application domains.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SeerNet:,Predicting,Convolutional,Neural,Network,Feature-Map,Sparsity,Through,Low-Bit,Quantization"
276,Defending Against Adversarial Attacks by Randomized Diversification,"The vulnerability of machine learning systems to adversarial attacks questions their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose a randomized diversification as a defense strategy. We introduce a multi-channel architecture in a gray-box scenario, which assumes that the architecture of the classifier and the training data set are known to the attacker. The attacker does not only have access to a secret key and to the internal states of the system at the test time. The defender processes an input in multiple channels. Each channel introduces its own randomization in a special transform domain based on a secret key shared between the training and testing stages. Such a transform based randomization with a shared key preserves the gradients in key-defined sub-spaces for the defender but it prevents gradient back propagation and the creation of various bypass systems for the attacker. An additional benefit of multi-channel randomization is the aggregation that fuses soft-outputs from all channels, thus increasing the reliability of the final score. The sharing of a secret key creates an information advantage to the defender. Experimental evaluation demonstrates an increased robustness of the proposed method to a number of known state-of-the-art attacks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Defending,Against,Adversarial,Attacks,by,Randomized,Diversification"
277,"Rob-GAN: Generator, Discriminator, and Adversarial Attacker","We study two important concepts in adversarial deep learning---adversarial training and generative adversarial network (GAN).  Adversarial training is the technique used to improve the robustness of discriminator by combining adversarial attacker and discriminator in the training phase.  GAN is commonly used for image generation by jointly optimizing discriminator and generator. We show these two concepts are indeed closely related and can be used to strengthen each other---adding a generator to the adversarial training procedure can improve the robustness of discriminators, and adding an adversarial attack to GAN training can improve the convergence speed and lead to better generators. Combining these two insights, we develop a framework called Rob-GAN to jointly optimize generator and discriminator in the presence of adversarial attacks---the generator generates fake images to fool discriminator; the adversarial attacker perturbs real images to fool discriminator, and the discriminator wants to minimize loss under fake and adversarial images. Through this end-to-end training procedure, we are able to simultaneously improve the convergence speed of GAN training, the quality of synthetic images, and the robustness of discriminator under strong adversarial attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained classifier is more robust than the state-of-the-art adversarial training approach (Madry 2017), and the generator outperforms SN-GAN on ImageNet-143.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Rob-GAN:,Generator,,Discriminator,,and,Adversarial,Attacker"
278,Learning From Noisy Labels by Regularized Estimation of Annotator Confusion,"The predictive performance of supervised learning algorithms depends on the quality of labels. In a typical label collection process, multiple annotators provide subjective noisy estimates of the ""truth"" under the influence of their varying skill-levels and biases. Blindly treating these noisy labels as the ground truth limits the accuracy of learning algorithms in the presence of strong disagreement. This problem is critical for applications in domains such as medical imaging where both the annotation cost and inter-observer variability are high. In this work, we present a method for simultaneously learning the individual annotator model and the underlying true label distribution, using only noisy observations. Each annotator is modeled by a confusion matrix that is jointly estimated along with the classifier predictions. We propose to add a regularization term to the loss function that encourages convergence to the true annotator confusion matrix. We provide a theoretical argument as to how the regularization is essential to our approach both for the case of single annotator and multiple annotators. Despite the simplicity of the idea, experiments on image classification tasks with both simulated and real labels show that our method either outperforms or performs on par with the state-of-the-art methods and is capable of estimating the skills of annotators even with a single label available per image.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,From,Noisy,Labels,by,Regularized,Estimation,of,Annotator,Confusion"

A sequence of tasks is learned, one at a time, with all data of current task available but not of previous or future tasks. Task boundaries and identities are known at all times. This setup, however, is rarely encountered in practical applications.  Therefore we investigate how to transform  continual learning to an online setup. We develop a system that keeps on learning over time in a streaming fashion, with data distributions gradually changing and without the notion of separate tasks.  To this end, we build on the work on Memory Aware Synapses, and show how this method can be made online by providing a protocol to decide i) when to update the importance weights, ii) which data to use to update them, and iii) how to accumulate the importance weights at each update step.  Experimental results show the validity of the approach in the context of two applications: (self-)supervised learning of a face recognition model by watching soap series and learning a robot to avoid collisions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Task-Free,Continual,Learning"
280,Importance Estimation for Neural Network Pruning,"Structural pruning of neural network parameters reduces computational, energy, and memory transfer costs during inference. We propose a novel method that estimates the contribution of a neuron (filter) to the final loss and iteratively removes those with smaller scores. We describe two variations of our method using the first and second-order Taylor expansions to approximate a filter's contribution. Both methods scale consistently across any network layer without requiring per-layer sensitivity analysis and can be applied to any kind of layer, including skip connections. For modern networks trained on ImageNet, we measured experimentally a high (>93%) correlation between the contribution computed by our methods and a reliable estimate of the true importance.  Pruning with the proposed methods led to an improvement over state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, FLOPs, and parameter reduction. On ResNet-101, we achieve a 40% FLOPS reduction by removing 30% of the parameters, with a loss of 0.02% in the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Importance,Estimation,for,Neural,Network,Pruning"
281,Detecting Overfitting of Deep Generative Networks via Latent Recovery,"State of the art deep generative networks have achieved such realism that they can be suspected of memorizing training images. It is why it is not uncommon to include visualizations of training set nearest neighbors, to suggest generated images are not simply memorized. We argue this is not sufficient and motivates studying overfitting of deep generators with more scrutiny. We address this question by i) showing how simple losses are highly effective at reconstructing images for deep generators ii) analyzing the statistics of reconstruction errors for training versus validation images. Using this methodology, we show that pure GAN models appear to generalize well, in contrast with those using hybrid adversarial losses, which are amongst the most widely applied generative methods. We also show that standard GAN evaluation metrics fail to capture memorization for some deep generators. Finally, we note the ramifications of memorization on data privacy. Considering the already widespread application of generative networks, we provide a step in the right direction towards the important yet incomplete picture of generative overfitting.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Detecting,Overfitting,of,Deep,Generative,Networks,via,Latent,Recovery"

To tackle this issue, we present a novel memory-augmented colorization model MemoPainter that can produce high-quality colorization with limited data. In particular, our model is able to capture rare instances and successfully colorize them. Also, we propose a novel threshold triplet loss that enables unsupervised training of memory networks without the need for class labels. Experiments show that our model has superior quality in both few-shot and one-shot colorization tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Coloring,With,Limited,Data:,Few-Shot,Colorization,via,Memory,Augmented,Networks"
283,Characterizing and Avoiding Negative Transfer,"When labeled data is scarce for a specific target task, transfer learning often offers an effective solution by utilizing data from a related source task. However, when transferring knowledge from a less related source, it may inversely hurt the target performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer. Despite its pervasiveness, negative transfer is usually described in an informal manner, lacking rigorous definition, careful analysis, or systematic treatment. This paper proposes a formal definition of negative transfer and analyzes three important aspects thereof. Stemming from this analysis, a novel technique is proposed to circumvent negative transfer by filtering out unrelated source data. Based on adversarial networks, the technique is highly generic and can be applied to a wide range of transfer learning algorithms. The proposed approach is evaluated on six state-of-the-art deep transfer methods via experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying levels of difficulty. Empirically, the proposed method consistently improves the performance of all baseline methods and largely avoids negative transfer, even when the source data is degenerate.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Characterizing,and,Avoiding,Negative,Transfer"
284,Building Efficient Deep Neural Networks With Unitary Group Convolutions,"We propose unitary group convolutions (UGConvs), a building block for CNNs which compose a group convolution with unitary transforms in feature space to learn a richer set of representations than group convolution alone. UGConvs generalize two disparate ideas in CNN architecture, channel shuffling (i.e. ShuffleNet) and block-circulant networks (i.e. CirCNN), and provide unifying insights that lead to a deeper understanding of each technique. We experimentally demonstrate that dense unitary transforms can outperform channel shuffling in DNN accuracy. On the other hand, different dense transforms exhibit comparable accuracy performance. Based on these observations we propose HadaNet, a UGConv network using Hadamard transforms. HadaNets achieve similar accuracy to circulant networks with lower computation complexity, and better accuracy than ShuffleNets with the same number of parameters and floating-point multiplies.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Building,Efficient,Deep,Neural,Networks,With,Unitary,Group,Convolutions"

However, existing graph CNNs generally use a fixed graph which may not be optimal for semi-supervised learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Learning-Convolutional Network (GLCN) for graph data representation and semi-supervised learning. The aim of GLCN is to learn an optimal graph structure that best serves graph CNNs for semi-supervised learning by integrating both graph learning and graph convolution in a unified network architecture. The main advantage is that in GLCN both given labels and the estimated labels are incorporated and thus can provide useful 'weakly' supervised information to refine (or learn) the graph construction and also to facilitate the graph convolution operation for unknown label estimation. Experimental results on seven benchmarks demonstrate that GLCN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art traditional fixed structure based graph CNNs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semi-Supervised,Learning,With,Graph,Learning-Convolutional,Networks"
286,Learning to Remember: A Synaptic Plasticity Driven Framework for Continual Learning,"Models trained in the context of continual learning (CL) should be able to learn from a stream of data over an undefined period of time. The main challenges herein are: 1) maintaining old knowledge while simultaneously benefiting from it when learning new tasks, and 2) guaranteeing model scalability with a growing amount of data to learn from. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Generative Memory (DGM) - synaptic plasticity driven framework for continual learning. DGM relies on conditional generative adversarial networks with learnable connection plasticity realized with neural masking. Specifically, we evaluate two variants of neural masking: applied to (i) layer activations and (ii) to connection weights directly. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic network expansion mechanism that ensures sufficient model capacity to accommodate for continually incoming tasks. The amount of added capacity is determined dynamically from the learned binary mask. We evaluate DGM in the continual class-incremental setup on visual classification tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Remember:,A,Synaptic,Plasticity,Driven,Framework,for,Continual,Learning"

While manual verification is possible, given vast amounts of verified knowledge available on the internet, the increasing prevalence and ease of this form of semantic manipulation call for the development of robust automatic ways of assessing the semantic integrity of multimedia data. In this paper, we present a novel method for image repurposing detection that is based on the real-world adversarial interplay between a bad actor who repurposes images with counterfeit metadata and a watchdog who verifies the semantic consistency between images and their accompanying metadata, where both players have access to a reference dataset of verified content, which they can use to achieve their goals.

To tackle this problem, we propose a non-linear radial basis convolutional feature mapping by learning a Mahalanobis-like distance function. Our method then maps the convolutional features onto a linearly well-separated manifold, which prevents small adversarial perturbations from forcing a sample to cross the decision boundary. We test the proposed method on three publicly available image classification and segmentation datasets namely, MNIST, ISBI ISIC 2017 skin lesion segmentation, and NIH Chest X-Ray-14. We evaluate the robustness of our method to different gradient (targeted and untargeted) and non-gradient based attacks and compare it to several non-gradient masking defense strategies.

Current state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods typically require very time consuming hyper-parameter tuning, or require many iterations to solve an optimization based adversarial attack. To address this problem, we present a new family of trust region based adversarial attacks, with the goal of computing adversarial perturbations efficiently. We propose several attacks based on variants of the trust region optimization method. We test the proposed methods on Cifar-10 and ImageNet datasets using several different models including AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and DenseNet-121 models. Our methods achieve comparable results with the Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack, but with significant speed up of up to 37x, for the VGG-16 model on a Titan Xp GPU. For the case of ResNet-50 on ImageNet, we can bring down its classification accuracy to less than 0.1% with at most 1.5% relative L_infinity (or L_2) perturbation requiring only 1.02 seconds as compared to 27.04 seconds for the CW attack.

290,PEPSI : Fast Image Inpainting With Parallel Decoding Network,"Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method employing the coarse-to-fine network with the contextual attention module (CAM) has shown outstanding results in image inpainting. However, this method requires numerous computational resources due to its two-stage process for feature encoding. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel network structure, called PEPSI: parallel extended-decoder path for semantic inpainting. PEPSI can reduce the number of convolution operations by adopting a structure consisting of a single shared encoding network and a parallel decoding network with coarse and inpainting paths. The coarse path produces a preliminary inpainting result with which the encoding network is trained to predict features for the CAM. At the same time, the inpainting path creates a higher-quality inpainting result using refined features reconstructed by the CAM. PEPSI not only reduces the number of convolution operation almost by half as compared to the conventional coarse-to-fine networks but also exhibits superior performance to other models in terms of testing time and qualitative scores.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PEPSI,:,Fast,Image,Inpainting,With,Parallel,Decoding,Network"

This is achieved by fine-tuning a pre-trained AWGN denoising network to the video with a novel frame-to-frame training strategy. Our denoiser can be used without knowledge of the origin of the video or burst and the post-processing steps applied from the camera sensor. The on-line process only requires a couple of frames before achieving visually pleasing results for a wide range of perturbations. It nonetheless reaches state-of-the-art performance for standard Gaussian noise, and  can be used off-line with still better performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Model-Blind,Video,Denoising,via,Frame-To-Frame,Training"

The idea is to hierarchically quantize the representation so that the quantization granularity is greatly increased while maintaining the accuracy and keeping the computational complexity low. We also show that the problem of finding the optimal sparse compound hash code respecting the hierarchical structure can be optimized in polynomial time via minimum cost flow in an equivalent flow network. This allows us to train the method end-to-end in a mini-batch stochastic gradient descent setting. Our experiments on Cifar100 and ImageNet datasets show the state of the art search accuracy while providing several orders of magnitude search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search over the dataset.,http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"End-To-End,Efficient,Representation,Learning,via,Cascading,Combinatorial,Optimization"
293,Sim-Real Joint Reinforcement Transfer for 3D Indoor Navigation,"There has been an increasing interest in 3D indoor navigation, where a robot in an environment moves to a target according to an instruction. To deploy a robot for navigation in the physical world, lots of training data is required to learn an effective policy.  It is quite labour intensive to obtain sufficient real environment data for training robots while synthetic data is much easier to construct by render-ing.  Though it is promising to utilize the synthetic environments to facilitate navigation training in the real world, real environment are heterogeneous from synthetic environment in two aspects.  First, the visual representation of the two environments have significant variances. Second, the houseplans of these two environments are quite different.  There-fore two types of information,i.e. visual representation and policy  behavior,  need  to  be  adapted  in  the  reinforce mentmodel. The learning procedure of visual representation and that of policy behavior are presumably reciprocal. We pro-pose to jointly adapt visual representation and policy behavior to leverage the mutual impacts of environment and policy. Specifically, our method employs an adversarial feature adaptation model for visual representation transfer anda policy mimic strategy for policy behavior imitation.

Instead of developing new building blocks or using computationally-intensive reinforcement learning algorithms, our approach leverages existing efficient network building blocks and focuses on exploiting hardware traits and adapting computation resources to fit target latency and/or energy constraints. We formulate platform-aware NN architecture search in an optimization framework and propose a novel algorithm to search for optimal architectures aided by efficient accuracy and resource (latency and/or energy) predictors. At the core of our algorithm lies an accuracy predictor built atop Gaussian Process with Bayesian optimization for iterative sampling. With a one-time building cost for the predictors, our algorithm produces state-of-the-art model architectures on different platforms under given constraints in just minutes. Our results show that adapting computation resources to building blocks is critical to model performance. Without the addition of any special features, our models achieve significant accuracy improvements relative to state-of-the-art handcrafted and automatically designed architectures. We achieve 73.8% and 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at 20ms latency on a mobile CPU and DSP.

However, training BNNs is difficult since the activation flow encounters degeneration, saturation, and gradient mismatch problems. Prior work alleviates these issues by increasing activation bits and adding floating-point scaling factors, thereby sacrificing BNN's energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose to use distribution loss to explicitly regularize the activation flow, and develop a framework to systematically formulate the loss. Our experiments show that the distribution loss can consistently improve the accuracy of BNNs without losing their energy benefits. Moreover, equipped with the proposed regularization, BNN training is shown to be robust to the selection of hyper-parameters including optimizer and learning rate.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Regularizing,Activation,Distribution,for,Training,Binarized,Deep,Networks"

Existing robustness verification approaches rely on  computing the over-approximation of the output set, and can hardly scale up to practical CDNNs, as the result of error accumulation accompanied with approximation. In this paper, we develop a novel method for robustness verification of CDNNs with sigmoid activation functions. It converts the robustness verification problem into an equivalent problem of inspecting the most suspected point in the input region which constitutes a nonlinear optimization problem. To make it amenable, by relaxing the nonlinear constraints into the linear inclusions, it is further refined as a linear programming problem. We conduct comparison experiments on a few CDNNs trained for classifying images in some state-of-the-art benchmarks, showing our advantages of precision and scalability that enable effective verification of practical CDNNs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Robustness,Verification,of,Classification,Deep,Neural,Networks,via,Linear,Programming"

Typical authentication applications include face recognition, person re-identification, authentication based on mobile devices and so on. The recently-emerging data-driven authentication process may encounter undesired biases, i.e., the models are often trained in one domain (e.g., for people wearing spring outfits) while required to apply in other domains (e.g., they change the clothes to summer outfits). To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage method that disentangles the class/identity from domain-differences, and we consider multiple types of domain-difference. In the first stage, we learn disentangled representations by a one-versus-rest disentangle learning (OVRDL) mechanism. In the second stage, we improve the disentanglement by an additive adversarial learning (AAL) mechanism. Moreover, we discuss the necessity to avoid a learning dilemma due to disentangling causally related types of domain-difference.

298,Simultaneously Optimizing Weight and Quantizer of Ternary Neural Network Using Truncated Gaussian Approximation,"In the past years, Deep convolution neural network has achieved great success in many artificial intelligence applications. However, its enormous model size and massive computation cost have become the main obstacle for deployment of such powerful algorithm in the low power and resource-limited mobile systems. As the countermeasure to this problem, deep neural networks with ternarized weights (i.e. -1, 0, +1) have been widely explored to greatly reduce model size and computational cost, with limited accuracy degradation. In this work, we propose a novel ternarized neural network training method which simultaneously optimizes both weights and quantizer during training, differentiating from prior works. Instead of fixed and uniform weight ternarization, we are the first to incorporate the thresholds of weight ternarization into a closed-form representation using truncated Gaussian approximation, enabling simultaneous optimization of weights and quantizer through back-propagation training. With both of the first and last layer ternarized, the experiments on the ImageNet classification task show that our ternarized ResNet-18/34/50 only has 3.9/2.52/2.16% accuracy degradation in comparison to the full-precision counterparts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Simultaneously,Optimizing,Weight,and,Quantizer,of,Ternary,Neural,Network,Using,Truncated,Gaussian,Approximation"

300,Exploring Object Relation in Mean Teacher for Cross-Domain Detection,"Rendering synthetic data (e.g., 3D CAD-rendered images) to generate annotations for learning deep models in vision tasks has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, simply applying the models learnt on synthetic images may lead to high generalization error on real images due to domain shift. To address this issue, recent progress in cross-domain recognition has featured the Mean Teacher, which directly simulates unsupervised domain adaptation as semi-supervised learning. The domain gap is thus naturally bridged with consistency regularization in a teacher-student scheme. In this work, we advance this Mean Teacher paradigm to be applicable for cross-domain detection. Specifically, we present Mean Teacher with Object Relations (MTOR) that novelly remolds Mean Teacher under the backbone of Faster R-CNN by integrating the object relations into the measure of consistency cost between teacher and student modules. Technically, MTOR firstly learns relational graphs that capture similarities between pairs of regions for teacher and student respectively. The whole architecture is then optimized with three consistency regularizations: 1) region-level consistency to align the region-level predictions between teacher and student, 2) inter-graph consistency for matching the graph structures between teacher and student, and 3) intra-graph consistency to enhance the similarity between regions of same class within the graph of student. Extensive experiments are conducted on the transfers across Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, and SIM10k, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, we obtain a new record of single model: 22.8% of mAP on Syn2Real detection dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Exploring,Object,Relation,in,Mean,Teacher,for,Cross-Domain,Detection"
301,Hierarchical Disentanglement of Discriminative Latent Features for Zero-Shot Learning,"Most studies in zero-shot learning model the relationship, in the form of a classifier or mapping, between features from images of seen classes and their attributes. Therefore, the degree of a model's generalization ability for recognizing unseen images is highly constrained by that of image features and attributes. In this paper, we discuss two questions about generalization that are seldom discussed. Are image features trained with samples of seen classes expressive enough to capture the discriminative information for both seen and unseen classes? Is the relationship learned from seen image features and attributes sufficiently generalized to recognize unseen classes. To answer these two questions, we propose a model to learn discriminative and generalizable representations from image features under an auto-encoder framework. The discriminative latent features are learned through a group-wise disentanglement over feature groups with a hierarchical structure. On popular benchmark data sets, a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in tasks of typical and generalized zero-shot learning verifies the generalization ability of latent features for recognizing unseen images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hierarchical,Disentanglement,of,Discriminative,Latent,Features,for,Zero-Shot,Learning"

This paper studies a new version of GAN, named Recipe Retrieval Generative Adversarial Network (R2GAN), to explore the feasibility of generating image from procedure text for retrieval problem. The motivation of using GAN is twofold: learning compatible cross-modal features in an adversarial way, and explanation of search results by showing the images generated from recipes. The novelty of R2GAN comes from architecture design, specifically a GAN with one generator and dual discriminators is used, which makes the generation of image from recipe a feasible idea. Furthermore, empowered by the generated images, a two-level ranking loss in both embedding and image spaces are considered. These add-ons not only result in excellent retrieval performance, but also generate close-to-realistic food images useful for explaining ranking of recipes.

303,Rethinking Knowledge Graph Propagation for Zero-Shot Learning,"Graph convolutional neural networks have recently shown great potential for the task of zero-shot learning. These models are highly sample efficient as related concepts in the graph structure share statistical strength allowing generalization to new classes when faced with a lack of data. However, multi-layer architectures, which are required to propagate knowledge to distant nodes in the graph, dilute the knowledge by performing extensive Laplacian smoothing at each layer and thereby consequently decrease performance. In order to still enjoy the benefit brought by the graph structure while preventing dilution of knowledge from distant nodes, we propose a Dense Graph Propagation (DGP) module with carefully designed direct links among distant nodes. DGP allows us to exploit the hierarchical graph structure of the knowledge graph through additional connections. These connections are added based on a node's relationship to its ancestors and descendants. A weighting scheme is further used to weigh their contribution depending on the distance to the node to improve information propagation in the graph.

In particular, we study how to generalize the classification parameters from previously learned concepts to a new concept. we first propose a novel Visual Analogy Graph Embedded Regression (VAGER) model to jointly learn a low-dimensional embedding space and a linear mapping function from the embedding space to classification parameters for base classes. We then propose an out-of-sample embedding method to learn the embedding of a new class represented by a few samples through its visual analogy with base classes and derive the classification parameters for the new class. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet dataset and the results show that our method could consistently and significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Learn,Image,Classifiers,With,Visual,Analogy"
305,Where's Wally Now? Deep Generative and Discriminative Embeddings for Novelty Detection,"We develop a framework for novelty detection (ND) methods relying on deep embeddings, either discriminative or generative, and also propose a novel framework for assessing their performance.  While much progress was made recently in these approaches, it has been accompanied by certain limitations: most methods were tested on relatively simple problems (low resolution images / small number of classes) or involved non-public data; comparative performance has often proven inconclusive because of lacking statistical significance; and evaluation has generally been done on non-canonical problem sets of differing complexity, making apples-to-apples comparative performance evaluation difficult. This has led to a relative confusing state of affairs.  We address these challenges via the following contributions: We make a proposal for a novel framework to measure the performance of novelty detection methods using a trade-space demonstrating performance (measured by ROCAUC) as a function of problem complexity. We also make several proposals to formally characterize problem complexity.   We conduct  experiments with problems of higher complexity (higher image resolution / number of classes).  To this end we design several canonical datasets built from CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (IN-125) which we make available to perform future benchmarks for novelty detection as well as other related tasks including semantic zero/adaptive shot and unsupervised learning.    Finally, we demonstrate, as one of the methods in our ND framework, a generative novelty detection method whose performance exceeds that of  all recent best-in-class generative ND methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Where's,Wally,Now?,Deep,Generative,and,Discriminative,Embeddings,for,Novelty,Detection"

While there are a number of studies on weakly supervised image classification, they usually limited to either single-label or multi-label scenarios. In this work, we propose an effective approach for weakly supervised image classification utilizing massive noisy labeled data with only a small set of clean labels (e.g., 5%). The proposed approach consists of a clean net and a residual net, which aim to learn a mapping from feature space to clean label space and a residual mapping from feature space to the residual between clean labels and noisy labels, respectively, in a multi-task learning manner. Thus, the residual net works as a regularization term to improve the clean net training. We evaluate the proposed approach on two multi-label datasets (OpenImage and MS COCO2014) and a single-label dataset (Clothing1M). Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and generalizes well to both single-label and multi-label scenarios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly,Supervised,Image,Classification,Through,Noise,Regularization"
307,Data-Driven Neuron Allocation for Scale Aggregation Networks,"Successful visual recognition networks benefit from aggregating information spanning from a wide range of scales. Previous research has investigated information fusion of connected layers or multiple branches in a block, seeking to strengthen the power of multi-scale representations. Despite their great successes, existing practices often allocate the neurons for each scale manually, and keep the same ratio in all aggregation blocks of an entire network, rendering suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose to learn the neuron allocation for aggregating multi-scale information in different building blocks of a deep network. The most informative output neurons in each block are preserved while others are discarded, and thus neurons for multiple scales are competitively and adaptively allocated. Our scale aggregation network (ScaleNet) is constructed by repeating a scale aggregation (SA) block that concatenates feature maps at a wide range of scales. Feature maps for each scale are generated by a stack of downsampling, convolution and upsampling operations. The data-driven neuron allocation and SA block achieve strong representational power at the cost of considerably low computational complexity. The proposed ScaleNet, by replacing all 3x3 convolutions in ResNet with our SA blocks, achieves better performance than ResNet and its outstanding variants like ResNeXt and SE-ResNet, in the same computational complexity. On ImageNet classification, ScaleNets absolutely reduce the top-1 error rate of ResNets by 1.12 (101 layers) and 1.82 (50 layers). On COCO object detection, ScaleNets absolutely improve the mAP with backbone of ResNets by 3.6 and 4.6 on Faster-RCNN, respectively.

308,Graphical Contrastive Losses for Scene Graph Parsing,"Most scene graph parsers use a two-stage pipeline to detect visual relationships: the first stage detects entities, and the second predicts the predicate for each entity pair using a softmax distribution. We find that such pipelines, trained with only a cross entropy loss over predicate classes, suffer from two common errors. The first, Entity Instance Confusion, occurs when the model confuses multiple instances of the same type of entity (e.g. multiple cups). The second, Proximal Relationship Ambiguity, arises when multiple subject-predicate-object triplets appear in close proximity with the same predicate, and the model struggles to infer the correct subject-object pairings (e.g. mis-pairing musicians and their instruments). We propose a set of contrastive loss formulations that specifically target these types of errors within the scene graph parsing problem, collectively termed the Graphical Contrastive Losses. These losses explicitly force the model to disambiguate related and unrelated instances through margin constraints specific to each type of confusion. We further construct a relationship detector, called RelDN, using the aforementioned pipeline to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed losses. Our model outperforms the winning method of the OpenImages Relationship Detection Challenge by 4.7% (16.5% relatively) on the test set. We also show improved results over the best previous methods on the Visual Genome and Visual Relationship Detection datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Graphical,Contrastive,Losses,for,Scene,Graph,Parsing"

In particular, we propose an  end-to-end deep-learning based approach in which we investigate how the knowledge contained in an external, out-of-distributional dataset can be used to improve the performance of a deep network for visual novelty detection.  Our solution differs from the standard deep classification networks on two accounts. First, we use a novel loss function, membership loss, in addition to the classical cross-entropy loss for training networks. Secondly, we use the knowledge from the external dataset more effectively to learn globally negative filters,  filters that respond to generic objects outside the known class set. We show that thresholding the maximal activation of the proposed network can be used to identify novel objects effectively. Extensive experiments on four publicly available novelty detection datasets show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Transfer,Learning,for,Multiple,Class,Novelty,Detection"
310,QATM: Quality-Aware Template Matching for Deep Learning,"Finding a template in a search image is one of the core problems in many computer vision applications, such as template matching, image semantic alignment, image-to-GPS verification etc.. In this paper, we propose a novel quality-aware template matching method, which is not only used as a standalone template matching algorithm, but also a trainable layer that can be easily plugged in any deep neural network. Specifically, we assess the quality of a matching pair as its soft-ranking among all matching pairs, and thus different matching scenarios like 1-to-1, 1-to-many, and many-to-many will be all reflected to different values. Our extensive studies in the classic template matching problem and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of QATM: it not only outperforms SOTA template matching methods when used alone, but also largely improves existing DNN solutions when used in DNN.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"QATM:,Quality-Aware,Template,Matching,for,Deep,Learning"

The proposed hybrid architecture combining a convolutional network and an off-the-shelf retrieval engine was designed to mitigate the adverse effect of off-manifold adversarial examples, while the proposed local mixup addresses on-manifold ones by explicitly encouraging the classifier to locally behave linearly on the data manifold. Our evaluation of the proposed approach against seven readilyavailable adversarial attacks on three datasets-CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet-demonstrate the improved robustness compared to a vanilla convolutional network, and comparable performance with the state-of-the-art reactive defense approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Retrieval-Augmented,Convolutional,Neural,Networks,Against,Adversarial,Examples"

An important task under the food-computing umbrella is retrieval, which is particularly helpful for health related applications, where we are interested in retrieving important information about food (e.g., ingredients, nutrition, etc.). In this paper, we investigate an open research task of cross-modal retrieval between cooking recipes and food images, and propose a novel framework Adversarial Cross-Modal Embedding (ACME) to resolve the cross-modal retrieval task in food domains. Specifically, the goal is to learn a common embedding feature space between the two modalities, in which our approach consists of several novel ideas: (i) learning by using a new triplet loss scheme together with an effective sampling strategy, (ii) imposing modality alignment using an adversarial learning strategy, and (iii) imposing cross-modal translation consistency such that the embedding of one modality is able to recover some important information of corresponding instances in the other modality. ACME achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark Recipe1M dataset, validating the efficacy of the proposed technique.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Cross-Modal,Embeddings,With,Adversarial,Networks,for,Cooking,Recipes,and,Food,Images"
313,FastDraw: Addressing the Long Tail of Lane Detection by Adapting a Sequential Prediction Network,"The search for predictive models that generalize to the long tail of sensor inputs is the central difficulty when developing data-driven models for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we use lane detection to study modeling and training techniques that yield better performance on real world test drives. On the modeling side, we introduce a novel fully convolutional model of lane detection that learns to decode lane structures instead of delegating structure inference to post-processing. In contrast to previous works, our convolutional decoder is able to represent an arbitrary number of lanes per image, preserves the polyline representation of lanes without reducing lanes to polynomials, and draws lanes iteratively without requiring the computational and temporal complexity of recurrent neural networks. Because our model includes an estimate of the joint distribution of neighboring pixels belonging to the same lane, our formulation includes a natural and computationally cheap definition of uncertainty. On the training side, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach to adapt the model to new environments using unsupervised style transfer. By training FastDraw to make predictions of lane structure that are invariant to low-level stylistic differences between images, we achieve strong performance at test time in weather and lighting conditions that deviate substantially from those of the annotated datasets that are publicly available. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on the CVPR 2017 Tusimple lane marking challenge, difficult CULane datasets [29], and a small labeled dataset of our own and achieve competitive accuracy while running at 90 FPS.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"FastDraw:,Addressing,the,Long,Tail,of,Lane,Detection,by,Adapting,a,Sequential,Prediction,Network"
314,Weakly Supervised Video Moment Retrieval From Text Queries,"There have been a few recent methods proposed in text to video moment retrieval using natural language queries, but requiring full supervision during training. However, acquiring a large number of training videos with temporal boundary annotations for each text description is extremely time-consuming and often not scalable. In order to cope with this issue, in this work, we introduce the problem of learning from weak labels for the task of text to video moment retrieval. The weak nature of the supervision is because, during training, we only have access to the video-text pairs rather than the temporal extent of the video to which different text descriptions relate. We propose a joint visual-semantic embedding based framework that learns the notion of relevant segments from video using only video-level sentence descriptions. Specifically, our main idea is to utilize latent alignment between video frames and sentence descriptions using Text-Guided Attention (TGA). TGA is then used during the test phase to retrieve relevant moments. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art fully supervised approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly,Supervised,Video,Moment,Retrieval,From,Text,Queries"

The user-provided clicks are transformed into guidance maps which provide the network with necessary cues on the whereabouts of the object of interest. Guidance maps used in current systems are purely distance-based and are either too localized or non-informative. We propose a novel transformation of user clicks to generate content-aware guidance maps that leverage the hierarchical structural information present in an image. Using our guidance maps, even the most basic FCNs are able to outperform existing approaches that require state-of-the-art segmentation networks pre-trained on large scale segmentation datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed transformation strategy through comprehensive experimentation in which we significantly raise state-of-the-art on four standard interactive segmentation benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Content-Aware,Multi-Level,Guidance,for,Interactive,Instance,Segmentation"
316,Greedy Structure Learning of Hierarchical Compositional Models,"In this work, we consider the problem of learning a hierarchical generative model of an object from a set of images which show examples of the object in the presence of variable background clutter. Existing approaches to this problem are limited by making strong a-priori assumptions about the object's geometric structure and require seg- mented training data for learning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning hierarchical compositional models (HCMs) which do not suffer from the mentioned limitations. We present a generalized formulation of HCMs and describe a greedy structure learning framework that consists of two phases: Bottom-up part learning and top-down model composition. Our framework integrates the foreground-background segmentation problem into the structure learning task via a background model. As a result, we can jointly optimize for the number of layers in the hierarchy, the number of parts per layer and a foreground- background segmentation based on class labels only. We show that the learned HCMs are semantically meaningful and achieve competitive results when compared to other generative object models at object classification on a standard transfer learning dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Greedy,Structure,Learning,of,Hierarchical,Compositional,Models"
317,Interactive Full Image Segmentation by Considering All Regions Jointly,"We address interactive full image annotation, where the goal is to accurately segment all object and stuff regions in an image. We propose an interactive, scribble-based annotation framework which operates on the whole image to produce segmentations for all regions. This enables sharing scribble corrections across regions, and allows the annotator to focus on the largest errors made by the machine across the whole image. To realize this, we adapt Mask-RCNN [22] into a fast interactive segmentation framework and introduce an instance-aware loss measured at the pixel-level in the full image canvas, which lets predictions for nearby regions properly compete for space.  Finally, we compare to interactive single object segmentation on the COCO panoptic dataset [11, 27, 34]. We demonstrate that our interactive full image segmentation approach leads to a 5% IoU gain, reaching 90% IoU at a budget of four extreme clicks and four corrective scribbles per region",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Interactive,Full,Image,Segmentation,by,Considering,All,Regions,Jointly"

New models based on deep learning have improved results but are restricted to pixel-wise fitting of the segmentation map. Our aim was to tackle this limitation by developing a new model based on deep learning which takes into account the area inside as well as outside the region of interest as well as the size of boundaries during learning. Specifically, we propose a new loss function which incorporates area and size information and integrates this into a dense deep learning model. We evaluated our approach on a dataset of more than 2,000 cardiac MRI scans. Our results show that the proposed loss function outperforms other mainstream loss function Cross-entropy on two common segmentation networks.

319,Customizable Architecture Search for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a Customizable Architecture Search (CAS) approach to automatically generate a network architecture for semantic image segmentation. The generated network consists of a sequence of stacked computation cells. A computation cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph, in which each node is a hidden representation (i.e., feature map) and each edge is associated with an operation (e.g., convolution and pooling), which transforms data to a new layer. During the training, the CAS algorithm explores the search space for an optimized computation cell to build a network. The cells of the same type share one architecture but with different weights. In real applications, however, an optimization may need to be conducted under some constraints such as GPU time and model size. To this end, a cost corresponding to the constraint will be assigned to each operation. When an operation is selected during the search, its associated cost will be added to the objective. As a result, our CAS is able to search an optimized architecture with customized constraints. The approach has been thoroughly evaluated on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, and demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art techniques. More remarkably, our CAS achieves 72.3% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset with speed of 108 FPS on an Nvidia TitanXp GPU.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Customizable,Architecture,Search,for,Semantic,Segmentation"
320,Local Features and Visual Words Emerge in Activations,"We propose a novel method of deep spatial matching (DSM) for image retrieval. Initial ranking is based on image descriptors extracted from convolutional neural network activations by global pooling, as in recent state-of-the-art work. However, the same sparse 3D activation tensor is also approximated by a collection of local features. These local features are then robustly matched to approximate the optimal alignment of the tensors. This happens without any network modification, additional layers or training. No local feature detection happens on the original image. No local feature descriptors and no visual vocabulary are needed throughout the whole process.  We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks across different network architectures and different global pooling methods. The highest gain in performance is achieved when diffusion on the nearest-neighbor graph of global descriptors is initiated from spatially verified images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Local,Features,and,Visual,Words,Emerge,in,Activations"
321,Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution With Optimized RGB Guidance,"To overcome the limitations of existing hyperspectral cameras on   spatial/temporal resolution, fusing a low resolution hyperspectral image (HSI)   with a high resolution RGB (or multispectral) image into a high resolution HSI   has been prevalent. Previous methods for this fusion task usually employ   hand-crafted priors to model the underlying structure of the latent high   resolution HSI, and the effect of the camera spectral response (CSR) of the   RGB camera on super-resolution accuracy has rarely been investigated. In this   paper, we first present a simple and efficient convolutional neural network   (CNN) based method for HSI super-resolution in an unsupervised way, without   any prior training. Later, we append a CSR optimization layer onto the HSI   super-resolution network, either to automatically select the best CSR in a   given CSR dataset, or to design the optimal CSR under some physical   restrictions. Experimental results show our method outperforms the   state-of-the-arts, and the CSR optimization can further boost the accuracy of   HSI super-resolution.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hyperspectral,Image,Super-Resolution,With,Optimized,RGB,Guidance"
322,Adaptive Confidence Smoothing for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,"Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is the problem of learning a classifier where some classes have samples and others are learned from side information, like semantic attributes or text description, in a zero-shot learning fashion (ZSL). Training a single model that operates in these two regimes simultaneously is challenging. Here we describe a probabilistic approach that breaks the model into three modular components, and then combines them in a consistent way. Specifically, our model consists of three classifiers: A ""gating"" model that makes soft decisions if a sample is from a ""seen"" class, and two experts: a ZSL expert, and an expert model for seen classes. We address two main difficulties in this approach: How to provide an accurate estimate of the gating probability without any training samples for unseen classes; and how to use expert predictions when it observes samples outside of its domain.  The key insight to our approach is to pass information between the three models  to improve each one's accuracy, while maintaining the modular structure. We test our approach, adaptive confidence smoothing (COSMO), on four standard GZSL benchmark datasets and find that it largely outperforms state-of-the-art GZSL models. COSMO is also the first model that closes the gap and surpasses the performance of generative models for GZSL, even-though it is a light-weight model that is much easier to train and tune.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Adaptive,Confidence,Smoothing,for,Generalized,Zero-Shot,Learning"

Conventional patch-based haze removal algorithms (e.g. the Dark Channel prior) usually performs dehazing with a fixed patch size. However, it may produce several problems in recovered results such as oversaturation and color distortion. Therefore, in this paper, we designed an adaptive and automatic patch size selection model called the Patch Map Selection Network (PMS-Net) to select the patch size corresponding to each pixel. This network is designed based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), which can generate the patch map from the image to image. Experimental results on both synthesized and real-world hazy images show that, with the combination of the proposed PMS-Net, the performance in haze removal is much better than that of other state-of-the-art algorithms and we can address the problems caused by the fixed patch size.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PMS-Net:,Robust,Haze,Removal,Based,on,Patch,Map,for,Single,Images"

In this paper, we put forward Deep Spherical Quantization (DSQ), a novel method to make deep convolutional neural networks generate supervised and compact binary codes for efficient image search. Our approach simultaneously learns a mapping that transforms the input images into a low-dimensional discriminative space, and quantizes the transformed data points using multi-codebook quantization. To eliminate the negative effect of norm variance on codebook learning, we force the network to L_2 normalize the extracted features and then quantize the resulting vectors using a new supervised quantization technique specifically designed for points lying on a unit hypersphere. Furthermore, we introduce an easy-to-implement extension of our quantization technique that enforces sparsity on the codebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSQ and its sparse variant can generate semantically separable compact binary codes outperforming many state-of-the-art image retrieval methods on three benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Spherical,Quantization,for,Image,Search"

We released this data publicly, forming the largest existing dataset for instance segmentation. Moreover, by re-annotating part of the COCO dataset, we show that we can produce instance masks 3x faster than traditional polygon drawing tools while also providing better quality.

326,A Poisson-Gaussian Denoising Dataset With Real Fluorescence Microscopy Images,"Fluorescence microscopy has enabled a dramatic development in modern biology. Due to its inherently weak signal, fluorescence microscopy is not only much noisier than photography, but also presented with Poisson-Gaussian noise where Poisson noise, or shot noise, is the dominating noise source. To get clean fluorescence microscopy images, it is highly desirable to have effective denoising algorithms and datasets that are specifically designed to denoise fluorescence microscopy images. While such algorithms exist, no such datasets are available. In this paper, we fill this gap by constructing a dataset - the Fluorescence Microscopy Denoising (FMD) dataset - that is dedicated to Poisson-Gaussian denoising. The dataset consists of 12,000 real fluorescence microscopy images obtained with commercial confocal, two-photon, and wide-field microscopes and representative biological samples such as cells, zebrafish, and mouse brain tissues. We use image averaging to effectively obtain ground truth images and 60,000 noisy images with different noise levels. We use this dataset to benchmark 10 representative denoising algorithms and find that deep learning methods have the best performance. To our knowledge, this is the first real microscopy image dataset for Poisson-Gaussian denoising purposes and it could be an important tool for high-quality, real-time denoising applications in biomedical research.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Poisson-Gaussian,Denoising,Dataset,With,Real,Fluorescence,Microscopy,Images"
327,Task Agnostic Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Learning,"Meta-learning approaches have been proposed to tackle the few-shot learning problem. Typically, a meta-learner is trained on a variety of tasks in the hopes of being generalizable to new tasks. However, the generalizability on new tasks of a meta-learner could be fragile  when it is over-trained on existing tasks during meta-training phase. In other words, the initial model of a meta-learner could be too biased towards existing tasks to adapt to new tasks, especially when only very few examples are available to update the model. To avoid a biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, we propose a novel paradigm of Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML) algorithms. Specifically, we present an entropy-based approach that meta-learns an unbiased initial model with the largest uncertainty over the output labels by preventing it from over-performing in classification tasks. Alternatively, a more general inequality-minimization TAML is presented for more ubiquitous scenarios by directly minimizing the inequality of initial losses beyond the classification tasks wherever a suitable loss can be defined. Experiments on benchmarked datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform compared meta-learning algorithms in both few-shot classification and reinforcement learning tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Task,Agnostic,Meta-Learning,for,Few-Shot,Learning"

Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled classes into unlabeled classes to reduce human labeling effort. In this paper, we propose a novel progressive ensemble network model with multiple projected label embeddings to address zero-shot image recognition. The ensemble network is built by learning multiple image classification functions with a shared feature extraction network but different label embedding representations, which enhance the diversity of the classifiers and facilitate information transfer to unlabeled classes. A progressive training framework is then deployed to gradually label the most confident images in each unlabeled class with predicted pseudo-labels and update the ensemble network with the training data augmented by the pseudo-labels. The proposed model performs training on both labeled and unlabeled data. It can naturally bridge the domain shift problem in visual appearances and be extended to the generalized zero-shot learning scenario.

Computational pathology aims to develop similar tools for aiding pathologists in diagnosing digitized histopathological slides, which would improve diagnostic accuracy and productivity amidst increasing workloads. However, there is a lack of publicly-available databases of (1) localized patch-level images annotated with (2) a large range of Histological Tissue Type (HTT). As a result, computational pathology research is constrained to diagnosing specific diseases or classifying tissues from specific organs, and cannot be readily generalized to handle unexpected diseases and organs.  In this paper, we propose a new digital pathology database, the ""Atlas of Digital Pathology"" (or ADP), which comprises of 17,668 patch images extracted from 100 slides annotated with up to 57 hierarchical HTTs. Our data is generalized to different tissue types across different organs and aims to provide training data for supervised multi-label learning of patch-level HTT in a digitized whole slide image.

Our approach explores existing bounds for singular subspaces and relates them to the 8-PA, without assuming any kind of error distribution for the matched features. In particular, if we use unit vectors as homogeneous image coordinates, we show that having a wide spatial distribution of matched features in both views tends to generate lower error bounds for the epipolar matrix error. Our experimental validation indicates that the bounds and the effective errors tend to decrease as the camera Field of View (FoV) increases, and that using the 8-PA for spherical images (that present 360degx180deg FoV) leads to accurate essential matrices.  As an additional contribution, we present bounds for the direction of the translation vector extracted from the essential matrix based on singular subspace analysis.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Perturbation,Analysis,of,the,8-Point,Algorithm:,A,Case,Study,for,Wide,FoV,Cameras"
332,Robustness of 3D Deep Learning in an Adversarial Setting,"Understanding the spatial arrangement and nature of real-world objects is of paramount importance to many complex engineering tasks, including autonomous navigation. Deep learning has revolutionized state-of-the-art performance for tasks in 3D environments; however, relatively little is known about the robustness of these approaches in an adversarial setting. The lack of comprehensive analysis makes it difficult to justify deployment of 3D deep learning models in real-world, safety-critical applications. In this work, we develop an algorithm for analysis of pointwise robustness of neural networks that operate on 3D data. We show that current approaches presented for understanding the resilience of state-of-the-art models vastly overestimate their robustness. We then use our algorithm to evaluate an array of state-of-the-art models in order to demonstrate their vulnerability to occlusion attacks. We show that, in the worst case, these networks can be reduced to 0% classification accuracy after the occlusion of at most 6.5% of the occupied input space.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Robustness,of,3D,Deep,Learning,in,an,Adversarial,Setting"
333,SceneCode: Monocular Dense Semantic Reconstruction Using Learned Encoded Scene Representations,"Systems which incrementally create 3D semantic maps from image sequences must store and update representations of both geometry and semantic entities. However, while there has been much work on the correct formulation for geometrical estimation, state-of-the-art systems usually rely on simple semantic representations which store and update independent label estimates for each surface element (depth pixels, surfels, or voxels). Spatial correlation is discarded, and fused label maps are incoherent and noisy.  We introduce a new compact and optimisable semantic representation by training a variational auto-encoder that is conditioned on a colour image. Using this learned latent space, we can tackle semantic label fusion by jointly optimising the low-dimenional codes associated with each of a set of overlapping images, producing consistent fused label maps which preserve spatial correlation. We also show how this approach can be used within a monocular keyframe based semantic mapping system where a similar code approach is used for geometry. The probabilistic formulation allows a flexible formulation where we can jointly estimate motion, geometry and semantics in a unified optimisation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SceneCode:,Monocular,Dense,Semantic,Reconstruction,Using,Learned,Encoded,Scene,Representations"

We utilize 3D dilated convolutions in our proposed cost filtering network that yields better filtering while almost halving the computational cost in comparison to state of the art cost filtering architectures. For feature extraction we use the Vortex Pooling architecture. The proposed method achieves state of the art results in KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and ETH 3D stereo benchmarks.

335,The Alignment of the Spheres: Globally-Optimal Spherical Mixture Alignment for Camera Pose Estimation,"Determining the position and orientation of a calibrated camera from a single image with respect to a 3D model is an essential task for many applications. When 2D-3D correspondences can be obtained reliably, perspective-n-point solvers can be used to recover the camera pose. However, without the pose it is non-trivial to find cross-modality correspondences between 2D images and 3D models, particularly when the latter only contains geometric information. Consequently, the problem becomes one of estimating pose and correspondences jointly. Since outliers and local optima are so prevalent, robust objective functions and global search strategies are desirable. Hence, we cast the problem as a 2D-3D mixture model alignment task and propose the first globally-optimal solution to this formulation under the robust L2 distance between mixture distributions. We derive novel bounds on this objective function and employ branch-and-bound to search the 6D space of camera poses, guaranteeing global optimality without requiring a pose estimate. To accelerate convergence, we integrate local optimization, implement GPU bound computations, and provide an intuitive way to incorporate side information such as semantic labels.

Previous work has made significant progress towards reconstruction of hand poses and object shapes in isolation. Yet, reconstructing hands and objects during manipulation is a more challeng- ing task due to significant occlusions of both the hand and object. While presenting challenges, manipulations may also simplify the problem since the physics of contact re- stricts the space of valid hand-object configurations. For example, during manipulation, the hand and object should be in contact but not interpenetrate. In this work, we regu- larize the joint reconstruction of hands and objects with ma- nipulation constraints. We present an end-to-end learnable model that exploits a novel contact loss that favors phys- ically plausible hand-object constellations. Our approach improves grasp quality metrics over baselines, using RGB images as input. To train and evaluate the model, we also propose a new large-scale synthetic dataset, ObMan, with hand-object manipulations. We demonstrate the transfer- ability of ObMan-trained models to real data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Joint,Reconstruction,of,Hands,and,Manipulated,Objects"
337,Deep Single Image Camera Calibration With Radial Distortion,"Single image calibration is the problem of predicting the camera parameters from one image. This problem is of importance when dealing with images collected in uncontrolled conditions by non-calibrated cameras, such as crowd-sourced applications. In this work we propose a method to predict extrinsic (tilt and roll) and intrinsic (focal length and radial distortion) parameters from a single image. We propose a parameterization for radial distortion that is better suited for learning than directly predicting the distortion parameters. Moreover, predicting additional heterogeneous variables exacerbates the problem of loss balancing. We propose a new loss function based on point projections to avoid having to balance heterogeneous loss terms. Our method is, to our knowledge, the first to jointly estimate the tilt, roll, focal length, and radial distortion parameters from a single image. We thoroughly analyze the performance of the proposed method and the impact of the improvements and compare with previous approaches for single image radial distortion correction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Single,Image,Camera,Calibration,With,Radial,Distortion"
338,CAM-Convs: Camera-Aware Multi-Scale Convolutions for Single-View Depth,"Single-view depth estimation suffers from the problem that a network trained on images from one camera does not generalize to images taken with a different camera model. Thus, changing the camera model requires collecting an entirely new training dataset. In this work, we propose a new type of convolution that can take the camera parameters into account, thus allowing neural networks to learn calibration-aware patterns. Experiments confirm that this improves the generalization capabilities of depth prediction networks considerably, and clearly outperforms the state of the art when the train and test images are acquired with different cameras.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CAM-Convs:,Camera-Aware,Multi-Scale,Convolutions,for,Single-View,Depth"
339,Translate-to-Recognize Networks for RGB-D Scene Recognition,"Cross-modal transfer is helpful to enhance modality-specific discriminative power for scene recognition. To this end, this paper presents a unified framework to integrate the tasks of cross-modal translation and modality-specific recognition, termed as Translate-to-Recognize Network TRecgNet. Specifically, both translation and recognition tasks share the same encoder network, which allows to explicitly regularize the training of recognition task with the help of translation, and thus improve its final generalization ability. For translation task, we place a decoder module on top of the encoder network and it is optimized with a new layer-wise semantic loss, while for recognition task, we use a linear classifier based on the feature embedding from encoder and its training is guided by the standard cross-entropy loss. In addition, our TRecgNet allows to exploit large numbers of unlabeled RGB-D data to train the translation task and thus improve the representation power of encoder network. Empirically, we verify that this new semi-supervised setting is able to further enhance the performance of recognition network. We perform experiments on two RGB-D scene recognition benchmarks: NYU Depth v2 and SUN RGB-D, demonstrating that TRecgNet achieves superior performance to the existing state-of-the-art methods, especially for recognition solely based on a single modality.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Translate-to-Recognize,Networks,for,RGB-D,Scene,Recognition"
340,Re-Identification Supervised Texture Generation,"The estimation of 3D human body pose and shape from a single image has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the texture generation problem has not been fully discussed. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning strategy to generate textures of human bodies under the supervision of person re-identification. We render the synthetic images with textures extracted from the inputs and maximize the similarity between the rendered and input images by using the re-identification network as the perceptual metrics. Experiment results on pedestrian images show that our model can generate the texture from a single image and demonstrate that our textures are of higher quality than those generated by other available methods. Furthermore, we extend the application scope to other categories and explore the possible utilization of our generated textures.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Re-Identification,Supervised,Texture,Generation"
341,Action4D: Online Action Recognition in the Crowd and Clutter,"Recognizing every person's action in a crowded and cluttered environment is a challenging task in computer vision. We propose to tackle this challenging problem using a holistic 4D ""scan"" of a cluttered scene to include every detail about the people and environment. This leads to a new problem, i.e., recognizing multiple people's actions in the cluttered 4D representation. At the first step, we propose a new method to track people in 4D, which can reliably detect and follow each person in real time. Then, we build a new deep neural network, the Action4DNet, to recognize the action of each tracked person. Such a model gives reliable and accurate results in the real-world settings. We also design an adaptive 3D convolution layer and a novel discriminative temporal feature learning objective to further improve the performance of our model. Our method is invariant to camera view angles, resistant to clutter and able to handle crowd. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast, reliable and accurate. Our method paves the way to action recognition in the real-world applications and is ready to be deployed to enable smart homes, smart factories and smart stores.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Action4D:,Online,Action,Recognition,in,the,Crowd,and,Clutter"
342,Monocular 3D Object Detection Leveraging Accurate Proposals and Shape Reconstruction,"We present MonoPSR, a monocular 3D object detection method that leverages proposals and shape reconstruction. First, using the fundamental relations of a pinhole camera model, detections from a mature 2D object detector are used to generate a 3D proposal per object in a scene. The 3D location of these proposals prove to be quite accurate, which greatly reduces the difficulty of regressing the final 3D bounding box detection. Simultaneously, a point cloud is predicted in an object centered coordinate system to learn local scale and shape  information. However, the key challenge is how to exploit shape information to guide 3D localization. As such, we devise aggregate losses, including a novel projection alignment loss, to jointly optimize these tasks in the neural network to improve 3D localization accuracy. We validate our method on the KITTI benchmark where we set new state-of-the-art results among published monocular methods, including the harder pedestrian and cyclist classes, while maintaining efficient run-time.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Monocular,3D,Object,Detection,Leveraging,Accurate,Proposals,and,Shape,Reconstruction"
343,Attribute-Aware Face Aging With Wavelet-Based Generative Adversarial Networks,"Since it is difficult to collect face images of the same subject over a long range of age span, most existing face aging methods resort to unpaired datasets to learn age mappings. However, the matching ambiguity between young and aged face images inherent to unpaired training data may lead to unnatural changes of facial attributes during the aging process, which could not be solved by only enforcing identity consistency like most existing studies do. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware face aging model with wavelet based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address the above issues. To be specific, we embed facial attribute vectors into both the generator and discriminator of the model to encourage each synthesized elderly face image to be faithful to the attribute of its corresponding input. In addition, a wavelet packet transform (WPT) module is incorporated to improve the visual fidelity of generated images by capturing age-related texture details at multiple scales in the frequency space. Qualitative results demonstrate the ability of our model in synthesizing visually plausible face images, and extensive quantitative evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attribute-Aware,Face,Aging,With,Wavelet-Based,Generative,Adversarial,Networks"
344,Noise-Tolerant Paradigm for Training Face Recognition CNNs,"Benefit from large-scale training datasets, deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have achieved impressive results in face recognition(FR). However, tremendous scale of datasets inevitably lead to noisy data, which obviously reduce the performance of the trained CNN models. Kicking out wrong labels from large-scale FR datasets is still very expensive, although some cleaning approaches are proposed. According to the analysis of the whole process of training CNN models supervised by angular margin based loss(AM-Loss) functions, we find that the  distribution of training samples implicitly reflects their probability of being clean. Thus, we propose a novel training paradigm that employs the idea of weighting samples based on the above probability. Without any prior knowledge of noise, we can train high performance CNN models with largescale FR datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our training paradigm.

345,Low-Rank Laplacian-Uniform Mixed Model for Robust Face Recognition,"Sparse representation based methods have successfully put forward a general framework for robust face recognition through linear reconstruction and sparsity constraints. However, residual modeling in existing works is not yet robust enough when dealing with dense noise. In this paper, we aim at recognizing identities from faces with varying levels of noises of various forms such as occlusion, pixel corruption, or disguise, and take improving the fitting ability of the error model as the key to addressing this problem. To fully capture the characteristics of different noises, we propose a mixed model combining robust sparsity constraint and low-rank constraint, which can deal with random errors and structured errors simultaneously. For random noises such as pixel corruption, we adopt a Laplacian-uniform mixed function for fitting the error distribution. For structured errors like continuous occlusion or disguise, we utilize robust nuclear norm to constrain the rank of the error matrix. An effective iterative reweighted algorithm is then developed to solve the proposed model. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark databases for robust face recognition, and the overall results demonstrate that our model is most robust against various kinds of noises, when compared with state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Low-Rank,Laplacian-Uniform,Mixed,Model,for,Robust,Face,Recognition"
346,Generalizing Eye Tracking With Bayesian Adversarial Learning,"Existing appearance-based gaze estimation approaches with CNN have poor generalization performance. By systematically studying this issue, we identify three major factors: 1) appearance variations; 2) head pose variations and 3) over-fitting issue with point estimation. To improve the generalization performance, we propose to incorporate adversarial learning and Bayesian inference into a unified framework. In particular, we first add an adversarial component into traditional CNN-based gaze estimator so that we can learn features that are gaze-responsive but can generalize to appearance and pose variations. Next, we extend the point-estimation based deterministic model to a Bayesian framework so that gaze estimation can be performed using all parameters instead of only one set of parameters. Besides improved performance on several benchmark datasets, the proposed method also enables online adaptation of the model to new subjects/environments, demonstrating the potential usage for practical real-time eye tracking applications.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generalizing,Eye,Tracking,With,Bayesian,Adversarial,Learning"
347,Local Relationship Learning With Person-Specific Shape Regularization for Facial Action Unit Detection,"Encoding individual facial expressions via action units (AUs) coded by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) has been found to be an effective approach in resolving the ambiguity issue among different expressions. While a number of methods have been proposed for AU detection, robust AU detection in the wild remains a challenging problem because of the diverse baseline AU intensities across individual subjects, and the weakness of appearance signal of AUs. To resolve these issues, in this work, we propose a novel AU detection method by utilizing local information and the relationship of individual local face regions. Through such a local relationship learning, we expect to utilize rich local information to improve the AU detection robustness against the potential perceptual inconsistency of individual local regions. In addition, considering the diversity in the baseline AU intensities of individual subjects, we further regularize local relationship learning via person-specific face shape information, i.e., reducing the influence of person-specific shape information, and obtaining more AU discriminative features. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two widely used AU detection datasets in the public domain (BP4D and DISFA).",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Local,Relationship,Learning,With,Person-Specific,Shape,Regularization,for,Facial,Action,Unit,Detection"
348,Point-To-Pose Voting Based Hand Pose Estimation Using Residual Permutation Equivariant Layer,"Recently, 3D input data based hand pose estimation methods have shown state-of-the-art performance, because 3D data capture more spatial information than the depth image. Whereas 3D voxel-based methods need a large amount of memory, PointNet based methods need tedious preprocessing steps such as K-nearest neighbour search for each point. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning hand pose estimation method for an unordered point cloud. Our method takes 1024 3D points as input and does not require additional information. We use Permutation Equivariant Layer (PEL) as the basic element, where a residual network version of PEL is proposed for the hand pose estimation task.  Furthermore, we propose a voting-based scheme to merge information from individual points to the final pose output. In addition to the pose estimation task, the voting-based scheme can also provide point cloud segmentation result without ground-truth for segmentation. We evaluate our method on both NYU dataset and the Hands2017Challenge dataset, where our method outperforms recent state-of-theart methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Point-To-Pose,Voting,Based,Hand,Pose,Estimation,Using,Residual,Permutation,Equivariant,Layer"
349,Improving Few-Shot User-Specific Gaze Adaptation via Gaze Redirection Synthesis,"As an indicator of human attention gaze is a subtle behavioral cue which can be exploited in many applications. However, inferring 3D gaze direction is challenging even for deep neural networks given the lack of large amount of data  (groundtruthing  gaze is expensive and existing datasets use different setups) and the inherent presence of gaze biases due to person-specific difference. In this work, we address the problem of person-specific gaze model adaptation from only a few reference training samples. The main and novel idea is to improve gaze adaptation by generating additional training samples through the synthesis of gaze-redirected eye images from  existing reference samples. In doing so, our contributions are threefold:(i) we design our gaze redirection framework from synthetic data, allowing us to benefit from aligned training sample pairs to predict accurate inverse mapping fields; (ii) we proposed a self-supervised approach for domain adaptation; (iii) we exploit the gaze redirection to improve the performance of person-specific gaze estimation.

350,AdaptiveFace: Adaptive Margin and Sampling for Face Recognition,"Training large-scale unbalanced data is the central topic in face recognition. In the past two years, face recognition has achieved remarkable improvements due to the introduction of margin based Softmax loss. However, these methods have an implicit assumption that all the classes possess sufficient samples to describe its distribution, so that a manually set margin is enough to equally squeeze each intra-class variations. However, real face datasets are highly unbalanced, which means the classes have tremendously different numbers of samples. In this paper, we argue that the margin should be adapted to different classes. We propose the Adaptive Margin Softmax to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively. In addition to the unbalance challenge, face data always consists of large-scale classes and samples. Smartly selecting valuable classes and samples to participate in the training makes the training more effective and efficient. To this end, we also make the sampling process adaptive in two folds: Firstly, we propose the Hard Prototype Mining to adaptively select a small number of hard classes to participate in classification. Secondly, for data sampling, we introduce the Adaptive Data Sampling to find valuable samples for training adaptively. We combine these three parts together as AdaptiveFace. Extensive analysis and experiments on LFW, LFW BLUFR and MegaFace show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods using the same network architecture and training dataset.

Specifically, a given 3D face shape is decomposed into identity part and expression part, which are both encoded and decoded in a nonlinear way. To solve this problem, we propose an attribute decomposition framework for 3D face mesh. To better represent face shapes which are usually nonlinear deformed between each other, the face shapes are represented by a vertex based deformation representation rather than Euclidean coordinates. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has better performance than existing methods on decomposing the identity and expression parts. Moreover, more natural expression transfer results can be achieved with our method than existing methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Disentangled,Representation,Learning,for,3D,Face,Shape"
352,LBS Autoencoder: Self-Supervised Fitting of Articulated Meshes to Point Clouds,"We present LBS-AE; a self-supervised autoencoding algorithm for fitting articulated mesh models to point clouds. As input, we take a sequence of point clouds to be registered as well as an artist-rigged mesh, i.e. a template mesh equipped with a linear-blend skinning (LBS) deformation space parameterized by a skeleton hierarchy. As output, we learn an LBS-based autoencoder that produces registered meshes from the input point clouds. To bridge the gap between the artist-defined geometry and the captured point clouds, our autoencoder models pose-dependent deviations from the template geometry. During training, instead of us- ing explicit correspondences, such as key points or pose supervision, our method leverages LBS deformations to boot- strap the learning process. To avoid poor local minima from erroneous point-to-point correspondences, we utilize a structured Chamfer distance based on part-segmentations, which are learned concurrently using self-supervision. We demonstrate qualitative results on real captured hands, and report quantitative evaluations on the FAUST benchmark for body registration. Our method achieves performance that is superior to other unsupervised approaches and com- parable to methods using supervised examples.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LBS,Autoencoder:,Self-Supervised,Fitting,of,Articulated,Meshes,to,Point,Clouds"

Our method outperforms previous methods at low resolution and in crowded, cluttered and occluded scenes thanks to (i) our new composite field PAF encoding fine-grained information and (ii) the choice of Laplace loss for regressions which incorporates a notion of uncertainty. Our architecture is based on a fully convolutional, single-shot, box-free design.

354,TACNet: Transition-Aware Context Network for Spatio-Temporal Action Detection,"Current state-of-the-art approaches for spatio-temporal action detection have achieved impressive results but remain unsatisfactory for temporal extent detection. The main reason comes from that, there are some ambiguous states similar to the real actions which may be treated as target actions even by a well trained network. In this paper, we define these ambiguous samples as ""transitional states"", and propose a Transition-Aware Context Network (TACNet) to distinguish transitional states. The proposed TACNet includes two main components, i.e., temporal context detector and transition-aware classifier. The temporal context detector can extract long-term context information with constant time complexity by constructing a recurrent network. The transition-aware classifier can further distinguish transitional states by classifying action and transitional states simultaneously. Therefore, the proposed TACNet can substantially improve the performance of spatio-temporal action detection. We extensively evaluate the proposed TACNet on UCF101-24 and J-HMDB datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TACNet obtains competitive performance on JHMDB and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the untrimmed UCF101 24 in terms of both frame-mAP and video-mAP.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"TACNet:,Transition-Aware,Context,Network,for,Spatio-Temporal,Action,Detection"

We model the dynamics and interaction of the coupled features in our novel Message-Passing Encoder-Decoder Recurrent Network. We observed that the decoupled features collaboratively interact in our spatio-temporal model to accurately identify human-related irregular events from surveillance video sequences.

In contrast to previous work, our proposed bilinear pooling is learnable and hence can capture more complex local statistics than the conventional counterpart. In addition, we introduce exact lower-dimension representations of our bilinear forms, so that the dimensionality is reduced without suffering from information loss nor requiring extra computation.

357,Improving Action Localization by Progressive Cross-Stream Cooperation,"Spatio-temporal action localization consists of three levels of tasks: spatial localization, action classification, and temporal segmentation. In this work, we propose a new Progressive Cross-stream Cooperation (PCSC) framework to iterative improve action localization results and generate better bounding boxes for one stream (i.e., Flow/RGB) by leveraging both region proposals and features  from another stream (i.e., RGB/Flow) in an iterative fashion. Specifically, we first generate a larger set of region proposals by combining the latest region proposals from both streams, from which we can readily obtain a larger set of labelled training samples to help learn better action detection models. Second, we also propose a new message passing approach to pass information from one stream to another stream in order to learn better representations, which also leads to better action detection models. As a result, our iterative framework progressively improves action localization results at the frame level. To improve action localization results at the video level, we additionally propose a new strategy to train class-specific actionness detectors for better temporal segmentation, which can be readily learnt by using the training samples around temporal boundaries. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed approaches for spatio-temporal action localization in realistic scenarios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Improving,Action,Localization,by,Progressive,Cross-Stream,Cooperation"
358,Two-Stream Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,"In skeleton-based action recognition, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which model the human body skeletons as spatiotemporal graphs, have achieved remarkable performance. However, in existing GCN-based methods, the topology of the graph is set manually, and it is fixed over all layers and input samples. This may not be optimal for the hierarchical GCN and diverse samples in action recognition tasks. In addition, the second-order information (the lengths and directions of bones) of the skeleton data, which is naturally more informative and discriminative for action recognition, is rarely investigated in existing methods. In this work, we propose a novel two-stream adaptive graph convolutional network (2s-AGCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. The topology of the graph in our model can be either uniformly or individually learned by the BP algorithm in an end-to-end manner. This data-driven method increases the flexibility of the model for graph construction and brings more generality to adapt to various data samples. Moreover, a two-stream framework is proposed to model both the first-order and the second-order information simultaneously, which shows notable improvement for the recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on the two large-scale datasets, NTU-RGBD and Kinetics-Skeleton, demonstrate that the performance of our model exceeds the state-of-the-art with a significant margin.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Two-Stream,Adaptive,Graph,Convolutional,Networks,for,Skeleton-Based,Action,Recognition"

This hinders the progress towards advanced video architectures. This paper presents an in-depth study of using large volumes of web videos for pre-training video models for the task of action recognition. Our primary empirical finding is that pre-training at a very large scale (over 65 million videos), despite on noisy social-media videos and hashtags, substantially improves the state-of-the-art on three challenging public action recognition datasets. Further, we examine three questions in the construction of weakly-supervised video action datasets. First, given that actions involve interactions with objects, how should one construct a verb-object pre-training label space to benefit transfer learning the most? Second, frame-based models perform quite well on action recognition; is pre-training for good image features sufficient or is pre-training for spatio-temporal features valuable for optimal transfer learning? Finally, actions are generally less well-localized in long videos vs. short videos; since action labels are provided at a video level, how should one choose video clips for best performance, given some fixed budget of number or minutes of videos?",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Large-Scale,Weakly-Supervised,Pre-Training,for,Video,Action,Recognition"
361,Learning Spatio-Temporal Representation With Local and Global Diffusion,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been regarded as a powerful class of models for visual recognition problems. Nevertheless, the convolutional filters in these networks are local operations while ignoring the large-range dependency. Such drawback becomes even worse particularly for video recognition, since video is an information-intensive media with complex temporal variations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to boost the spatio-temporal representation learning by Local and Global Diffusion (LGD). Specifically, we construct a novel neural network architecture that learns the local and global representations in parallel. The architecture is composed of LGD blocks, where each block updates local and global features by modeling the diffusions between these two representations. Diffusions effectively interact two aspects of information, i.e., localized and holistic, for more powerful way of representation learning. Furthermore, a kernelized classifier is introduced to combine the representations from two aspects for video recognition. Our LGD networks achieve clear improvements on the large-scale Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600 video classification datasets against the best competitors by 3.5% and 0.7%. We further examine the generalization of both the global and local representations produced by our pre-trained LGD networks on four different benchmarks for video action recognition and spatio-temporal action detection tasks.

One problem in this context arises from the need to define and label action boundaries to create annotations for training which is very time and cost intensive. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised approach for learning action classes from untrimmed video sequences. To this end, we use a continuous temporal embedding of framewise features to benefit from the sequential nature of activities. Based on the latent space created by the embedding, we identify clusters of temporal segments across  all videos that correspond to semantic meaningful action classes. The approach is evaluated on three challenging datasets, namely the Breakfast dataset, YouTube Instructions, and the 50Salads dataset. While previous works assumed that the videos contain the same high level activity, we furthermore show that the proposed approach can also be applied to a more general setting where the content of the videos is unknown.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Learning,of,Action,Classes,With,Continuous,Temporal,Embedding"
363,Double Nuclear Norm Based Low Rank Representation on Grassmann Manifolds for Clustering,"Unsupervised clustering for high-dimension data (such as imageset or video) is a hard issue in data processing and data mining area since these data always lie on a manifold (such as Grassmann manifold). Inspired of Low Rank representation theory, researchers proposed a series of effective clustering methods for high-dimension data with non-linear metric. However, most of these methods adopt the traditional single nuclear norm as the relaxation of the rank function, which would lead to suboptimal solution deviated from the original one. In this paper, we propose a new low rank model for high-dimension data clustering task on Grassmann manifold based on the Double Nuclear norm which is used to better approximate the rank minimization of matrix. Further, to consider the inner geometry or structure of data space, we integrated the adaptive Laplacian regularization to construct the local relationship of data samples.

Recent studies based on LSTM networks have shown great ability to learn social behaviors. However, many of these methods  rely on previous neighboring hidden states but ignore the important current intention of the neighbors. In order to address this issue, we propose a data-driven state refinement module for LSTM network (SR-LSTM), which activates the utilization of the current intention of neighbors, and jointly and iteratively refines the current states of all participants in the crowd through a message passing mechanism. To effectively extract the social effect of neighbors, we further introduce a social-aware information selection mechanism consisting of an element-wise motion gate and a pedestrian-wise attention to select useful message from neighboring pedestrians. Experimental results on two public datasets, i.e. ETH and UCY, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SR-LSTM and we achieve state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SR-LSTM:,State,Refinement,for,LSTM,Towards,Pedestrian,Trajectory,Prediction"
365,Unsupervised Deep Epipolar Flow for Stationary or Dynamic Scenes,"Unsupervised deep learning for optical flow computation has achieved promising results.  Most existing deep-net based methods rely on image brightness consistency and local smoothness constraint to train the networks.  Their performance degrades at regions where repetitive textures or occlusions occur.  In this paper, we propose Deep Epipolar Flow, an unsupervised optical flow method which incorporates global geometric constraints into network learning. In particular, we investigate multiple ways of enforcing the epipolar constraint in flow estimation.  To alleviate a ""chicken-and-egg"" type of problem encountered in dynamic scenes where multiple motions may be present, we propose a low-rank constraint as well as a union-of-subspaces constraint for training. Experimental results on various benchmarking datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised deep-learning methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Deep,Epipolar,Flow,for,Stationary,or,Dynamic,Scenes"
366,An Efficient Schmidt-EKF for 3D Visual-Inertial SLAM,"It holds great implications for practical applications to enable centimeter-accuracy positioning for mobile and wearable sensor systems. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-precision, efficient visual-inertial (VI)-SLAM algorithm, termed Schmidt-EKF VI-SLAM (SEVIS), which optimally fuses IMU measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear computational complexity in terms of map size,  instead of quadratic as in the standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual measurements and 3D map features. The proposed SEVIS is extensively validated in both simulations and experiments.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"An,Efficient,Schmidt-EKF,for,3D,Visual-Inertial,SLAM"
367,A Neural Temporal Model for Human Motion Prediction,"We propose novel neural temporal models for predicting and synthesizing human motion, achieving state-of-the-art in modeling long-term motion trajectories while being competitive with prior work in short-term prediction and requiring significantly less computation. Key aspects of our proposed system include: 1) a novel, two-level processing architecture that aids in generating planned trajectories, 2) a simple set of easily computable features that integrate derivative information, and 3) a novel multi-objective loss function that helps the model to slowly progress from simple next-step prediction to the harder task of multi-step, closed-loop prediction. Our results demonstrate that these innovations improve the modeling of long-term motion trajectories. Finally, we propose a novel metric, called Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS), to evaluate the long-term predictive ability of motion synthesis models, complementing the popular mean-squared error (MSE) measure of Euler joint angles over time. We conduct a user study to determine if the proposed NPSS correlates with human evaluation of long-term motion more strongly than MSE and find that it indeed does.

368,Multi-Agent Tensor Fusion for Contextual Trajectory Prediction,"Accurate prediction of others' trajectories is essential for autonomous driving. Trajectory prediction is challenging because it requires reasoning about agents' past movements, social interactions among varying numbers and kinds of agents, constraints from the scene context, and the stochasticity of human behavior. Our approach models these interactions and constraints jointly within a novel Multi-Agent Tensor Fusion (MATF) network. Specifically, the model encodes multiple agents' past trajectories and the scene context into a Multi-Agent Tensor, then applies convolutional fusion to capture multiagent interactions while retaining the spatial structure of agents and the scene context. The model decodes recurrently to multiple agents' future trajectories, using adversarial loss to learn stochastic predictions. Experiments on both highway driving and pedestrian crowd datasets show that the model achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Agent,Tensor,Fusion,for,Contextual,Trajectory,Prediction"
369,Coordinate-Based Texture Inpainting for Pose-Guided Human Image Generation,"We present a new deep learning approach to pose-guided resynthesis of human photographs. At the heart of the new approach is the estimation of the complete body surface texture based on a single photograph. Since the input photograph always observes only a part of the surface, we suggest a new inpainting method that completes the texture of the human body. Rather than working directly with colors of texture elements, the inpainting network estimates an appropriate source location in the input image for each element of the body surface. This correspondence field between the input image and the texture is then further warped into the target image coordinate frame based on the desired pose, effectively establishing the correspondence between the source and the target view even when the pose change is drastic. The final convolutional network then uses the established correspondence and all other available information to synthesize the output image.   A  fully-convolutional  architecture with deformable skip connections guided by the estimated correspondence field is used.  We show state-of-the-art result for pose-guided image synthesis. Additionally, we demonstrate the performance of our system for garment transfer and pose-guided face resynthesis.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Coordinate-Based,Texture,Inpainting,for,Pose-Guided,Human,Image,Generation"
370,On Stabilizing Generative Adversarial Training With Noise,"We present a novel method and analysis to train generative adversarial networks (GAN) in a stable manner. As shown in recent analysis, training is often undermined by the probability distribution of the data being zero on neighborhoods of the data space. We notice that the distributions of real and generated data should match even when they undergo the same filtering. Therefore, to address the limited support problem we propose to train GANs by using different filtered versions of the real and generated data distributions. In this way, filtering does not prevent the exact matching of the data distribution, while helping training by extending the support of both distributions. As filtering we consider adding samples from an arbitrary distribution to the data, which corresponds to a convolution of the data distribution with the arbitrary one. We also propose to learn the generation of these samples so as to challenge the discriminator in the adversarial training. We show that our approach results in a stable and well-behaved training of even the original minimax GAN formulation. Moreover, our technique can be incorporated in most modern GAN formulations and leads to a consistent improvement on several common datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"On,Stabilizing,Generative,Adversarial,Training,With,Noise"
371,Self-Supervised GANs via Auxiliary Rotation Loss,"Conditional GANs are at the forefront of natural image synthesis. The main drawback of such models is the necessity for labeled data. In this work we exploit two popular unsupervised learning techniques, adversarial training and self-supervision, and take a step towards bridging the gap between conditional and unconditional GANs. In particular, we allow the networks to collaborate on the task of representation learning, while being adversarial with respect to the classic GAN game. The role of self-supervision is to encourage the discriminator to learn meaningful feature representations which are not forgotten during training. We test empirically both the quality of the learned image representations, and the quality of the synthesized images. Under the same conditions, the self-supervised GAN attains a similar performance to state-of-the-art conditional counterparts. Finally, we show that this approach to fully unsupervised learning can be scaled to attain an FID of 23.4 on unconditional ImageNet generation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Supervised,GANs,via,Auxiliary,Rotation,Loss"
372,Texture Mixer: A Network for Controllable Synthesis and Interpolation of Texture,"This paper addresses the problem of interpolating visual textures. We formulate this problem by requiring (1) by-example controllability and (2) realistic and smooth interpolation among an arbitrary number of texture samples. To solve it we propose a neural network trained simultaneously on a reconstruction task and a generation task, which can project texture examples onto a latent space where they can be linearly interpolated and projected back onto the image domain, thus ensuring both intuitive control and realistic results. We show our method outperforms a number of baselines according to a comprehensive suite of metrics as well as a user study. We further show several applications based on our technique, which include texture brush, texture dissolve, and animal hybridization.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Texture,Mixer:,A,Network,for,Controllable,Synthesis,and,Interpolation,of,Texture"
373,Object-Driven Text-To-Image Synthesis via Adversarial Training,"In this paper, we propose Object-driven Attentive Generative Adversarial Newtorks (Obj-GANs) that allow attention-driven, multi-stage refinement for synthesizing complex images from text descriptions. With a novel object-driven attentive generative network, the Obj-GAN can synthesize salient objects by paying attention to their most relevant words in the text descriptions and their pre-generated class label. In addition, a novel object-wise discriminator based on the Fast R-CNN model is proposed to provide rich object-wise discrimination signals on whether the synthesized object matches the text description and the pre-generated class label. The proposed Obj-GAN significantly outperforms the previous state of the art in various metrics on the large-scale MS-COCO benchmark, increasing the inception score by 27% and decreasing the FID score by 11%. A thorough comparison between the classic grid attention and the new object-driven attention is provided through analyzing their mechanisms and visualizing their attention layers, showing insights of how the proposed model generates complex scenes in high quality.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Object-Driven,Text-To-Image,Synthesis,via,Adversarial,Training"
374,Zoom-In-To-Check: Boosting Video Interpolation via Instance-Level Discrimination,"We propose a light-weight video frame interpolation algorithm. Our key innovation is an instance-level supervision that allows information to be learned from the high-resolution version of similar objects.  Our experiment shows that the proposed method can generate state-of-the-art results across different datasets, with fractional computation resources (time and memory) of competing methods.   Given two image frames, a cascade network creates an intermediate frame with 1) a flow-warping module that computes coarse bi-directional optical flow and creates an interpolated image via flow-based warping, followed by 2) an image synthesis module to make fine-scale corrections. In the learning stage, object detection proposals are generated on the interpolated image. Lower resolution objects are zoomed into, and the learning algorithms using an adversarial loss trained on high-resolution objects to guide the system towards the instance-level refinement corrects details of object shape and boundaries.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Zoom-In-To-Check:,Boosting,Video,Interpolation,via,Instance-Level,Discrimination"
375,Disentangling Latent Space for VAE by Label Relevant/Irrelevant Dimensions,"VAE requires the standard Gaussian distribution as a prior in the latent space. Since all codes tend to follow the same prior, it often suffers the so-called ""posterior collapse"". To avoid this, this paper introduces the class specific distribution for the latent code. But different from CVAE, we present a method for disentangling the latent space into the label relevant and irrelevant dimensions, zs and zu, for a single input. We apply two separated encoders to map the input into zs and zu respectively, and then give the concatenated code to the decoder to reconstruct the input. The label irrelevant code zu represent the common characteristics of all inputs, hence they are constrained by the standard Gaussian, and their encoder is trained in amortized variational inference way, like VAE. While zs is assumed to follow the Gaussian mixture distribution in which each component corresponds to a particular class. The parameters for the Gaussian components in zs encoder are optimized by the label supervision in a global stochastic way. In theory, we show that our method is actually equivalent to adding a KL divergence term on the joint distribution of zs and the class label c, and it can directly increase the mutual information between zs and the label c. Our model can also be extended to GAN by adding a discriminator in the pixel domain so that it produces high quality and diverse images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Disentangling,Latent,Space,for,VAE,by,Label,Relevant/Irrelevant,Dimensions"
376,Spectral Reconstruction From Dispersive Blur: A Novel Light Efficient Spectral Imager,"Developing high light efficiency imaging techniques to retrieve high dimensional optical signal is a long-term goal in computational photography. Multispectral imaging, which captures images of different wavelengths and boosting the abilities for revealing scene properties, has developed rapidly in the last few decades. From scanning method to snapshot imaging, the limit of light collection efficiency is kept being pushed which enables wider applications especially under the light-starved scenes. In this work, we propose a novel multispectral imaging technique, that could capture the multispectral images with a high light efficiency. Through investigating the dispersive blur caused by spectral dispersers and introducing the difference of blur (DoB) constraints, we propose a basic theory for capturing multispectral information from a single dispersive-blurred image and an additional spectrum of an arbitrary point in the scene. Based on the theory, we design a prototype system and develop an optimization algorithm to realize snapshot multispectral imaging. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on both the synthetic data and real captured images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spectral,Reconstruction,From,Dispersive,Blur:,A,Novel,Light,Efficient,Spectral,Imager"

The method does not require any information about the illuminant in the scene and relies on the weak assumption, fulfilled by almost all images available on the web, that training images have been approximately balanced. Because of this requirement we define our method as quasi-unsupervised. After training, unbalanced images can be processed thanks to the preliminary conversion to grayscale of the input to the neural network.  The results of an extensive experimentation demonstrate that the proposed method is able to outperform the other unsupervised methods in the state of the art being, at the same time, flexible enough to be supervisedly fine-tuned to reach performance comparable with those of the best supervised methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Quasi-Unsupervised,Color,Constancy"
378,Deep Defocus Map Estimation Using Domain Adaptation,"In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, Defocus Map Estimation Network (DMENet), for spatially varying defocus map estimation. To train the network, we produce a novel depth-of-field (DOF) dataset, SYNDOF, where each image is synthetically blurred with a ground-truth depth map. Due to the synthetic nature of SYNDOF, the feature characteristics of images in SYNDOF can differ from those of real defocused photos. To address this gap, we use domain adaptation that transfers the features of real defocused photos into those of synthetically blurred ones. Our DMENet consists of four subnetworks: blur estimation, domain adaptation, content preservation, and sharpness calibration networks. The subnetworks are connected to each other and jointly trained with their corresponding supervisions in an end-to-end manner. Our method is evaluated on publicly available blur detection and blur estimation datasets and the results show the state-of-the-art performance.In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, Defocus Map Estimation Network (DMENet), for spatially varying defocus map estimation.

379,Using Unknown Occluders to Recover Hidden Scenes,"We consider the challenging problem of inferring a hidden moving scene from faint shadows cast on a diffuse surface. Recent work in passive non-line-of-sight (NLoS) imaging has shown that the presence of occluding objects in between the scene and the diffuse surface significantly improves the conditioning of the problem. However, that work assumes that the shape of the occluder is known a priori. In this paper, we relax this often impractical assumption, extending the range of applications for passive occluder-based NLoS imaging systems.  We formulate the task of jointly recovering the unknown scene and unknown occluder as a blind deconvolution problem, for which we propose a simple but effective two-step algorithm. At the first step, the algorithm exploits motion in the scene in order to obtain an estimate of the occluder. In particular, it exploits the fact that motion in realistic scenes is typically sparse. The second step is more standard: using regularization, we deconvolve by the occluder estimate to solve for the hidden scene.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with simulations and experiments in a variety of settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Using,Unknown,Occluders,to,Recover,Hidden,Scenes"
380,"Competitive Collaboration: Joint Unsupervised Learning of Depth, Camera Motion, Optical Flow and Motion Segmentation","We address the unsupervised learning of several interconnected problems in low-level vision: single view depth prediction, camera motion estimation, optical flow, and segmentation of a video into the static scene and moving regions. Our key insight is that these four fundamental vision problems are coupled through geometric constraints. Consequently, learning to solve them together simplifies the problem because the solutions can reinforce each other. We go beyond previous work by exploiting geometry more explicitly and segmenting the scene into static and moving regions. To that end, we introduce Competitive Collaboration, a framework that facilitates the coordinated training of multiple specialized neural networks to solve complex problems. Competitive Collaboration works much like expectation-maximization, but with neural networks that act as both competitors to explain pixels that correspond to static or moving regions, and as collaborators through a moderator that assigns pixels to be either static or independently moving. Our novel method integrates all these problems in a common framework and simultaneously reasons about the segmentation of the scene into moving objects and the static background, the camera motion, depth of the static scene structure, and the optical flow of moving objects.

However, it is challenging to incorporate this information for SR since disparities between stereo images vary significantly. In this paper, we propose a parallax-attention stereo superresolution network (PASSRnet) to integrate the information from a stereo image pair for SR. Specifically, we introduce a parallax-attention mechanism with a global receptive field along the epipolar line to handle different stereo images with large disparity variations. We also propose a new and the largest dataset for stereo image SR (namely, Flickr1024). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the parallax-attention mechanism can capture correspondence between stereo images to improve SR performance with a small computational and memory cost.

In this paper, we study the vulnerability of these models to attacks aimed at changing the output-size that can have undesirable consequences including increased computation and inducing faults in downstream modules that expect outputs of a certain length. We show the existence and construction of such attacks with two key contributions. First, to overcome the difficulties of discrete search space and the non-differentiable adversarial objective function, we develop an easy-to-compute differentiable proxy objective that can be used with gradient-based algorithms to find output-lengthening inputs. Second, we develop a verification approach to formally prove that the network cannot produce outputs greater than a certain length.  Experimental results on Machine Translation and Image Captioning models show that our adversarial output-lengthening approach can produce outputs that are 50 times longer than the input, while our verification approach can, given a model and input domain, prove that the output length is below a certain size.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Knowing,When,to,Stop:,Evaluation,and,Verification,of,Conformity,to,Output-Size,Specifications"
383,Spatial Attentive Single-Image Deraining With a High Quality Real Rain Dataset,"Removing rain streaks from a single image has been drawing considerable attention as rain streaks can severely degrade the image quality and affect the performance of existing outdoor vision tasks. While recent CNN-based derainers have reported promising performances, deraining remains an open problem for two reasons. First, existing synthesized rain datasets have only limited realism, in terms of modeling real rain characteristics such as rain shape, direction and intensity. Second, there are no public benchmarks for quantitative comparisons on real rain images, which makes the current evaluation less objective. The core challenge is that real world rain/clean image pairs cannot be captured at the same time. In this paper, we address the single image rain removal problem in two ways. First, we propose a semi-automatic method that incorporates temporal priors and human supervision to generate a high-quality clean image from each input sequence of real rain images. Using this method, we construct a large-scale dataset of  29.5K rain/rain-free image pairs that covers a wide range of natural rain scenes. Second, to better cover the stochastic distribution of real rain streaks, we propose a novel SPatial Attentive Network (SPANet) to remove rain streaks in a local-to-global manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art deraining methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spatial,Attentive,Single-Image,Deraining,With,a,High,Quality,Real,Rain,Dataset"

These asynchronous sensors offer several advantages over traditional cameras, such as, high temporal resolution, very high dynamic range, and no motion blur. To unlock the potential of such sensors, motion compensation methods have been recently proposed. We present a collection and taxonomy of twenty two objective functions to analyze event alignment in motion compensation approaches. We call them focus loss functions since they have strong connections with functions used in traditional shape-from-focus applications. The proposed loss functions allow bringing mature computer vision tools to the realm of event cameras. We compare the accuracy and runtime performance of all loss functions on a publicly available dataset, and conclude that the variance, the gradient and the Laplacian magnitudes are among the best loss functions. The applicability of the loss functions is shown on multiple tasks: rotational motion, depth and optical flow estimation.

However, the existing deep learning based image CS methods need to train different models for different sampling ratios, which increases the complexity of the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose a scalable convolutional neural network (dubbed SCSNet) to achieve scalable sampling and scalable reconstruction with only one model. Specifically, SCSNet provides both coarse and fine granular scalability. For coarse granular scalability, SCSNet is designed as a single sampling matrix plus a hierarchical reconstruction network that contains a base layer plus multiple enhancement layers. The base layer provides the basic reconstruction quality, while the enhancement layers reference the lower reconstruction layers and gradually improve the reconstruction quality. For fine granular scalability, SCSNet achieves sampling and reconstruction at any sampling ratio by using a greedy method to select the measurement bases. Compared with the existing deep learning based image CS methods, SCSNet achieves scalable sampling and quality scalable reconstruction at any sampling ratio with only one model. Experimental results demonstrate that SCSNet has the state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a comparable running speed with the existing deep learning based image CS methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Scalable,Convolutional,Neural,Network,for,Image,Compressed,Sensing"

In recent years, much of research in event based vision has been focused on performing tasks such as optic flow estimation, moving object segmentation, feature tracking, camera rotation estimation and more, through contrast maximization. In contrast maximization, events are warped along motion trajectories whose parameters depend on the quantity being estimated, to some time t_ref. The parameters are then scored by some reward function of the accumulated events at t_ref. The versatility of this approach has lead to a flurry of research in recent years, but no in-depth study of the reward chosen during optimization has yet been made. In this work we examine the choice of reward used in contrast maximization, propose a classification of different rewards and show how a reward can be constructed that is more robust to noise and aperture uncertainty.

Their special nature make them a fascinating tool to test and validate any new vision model proposed. In general, current vision models are based on the concatenation of linear and non-linear operations. The similarity of this structure with the operations present in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has motivated us to study if CNNs trained for low-level visual tasks are deceived by visual illusions. In particular, we show that CNNs trained for image denoising, image deblurring, and computational color constancy are able to replicate the human response to visual illusions, and that the extent of this replication varies with respect to variation in architecture  and spatial pattern size. These results suggest that in order to obtain CNNs that better replicate human behaviour, we may need to start aiming for them to better replicate visual illusions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Convolutional,Neural,Networks,Can,Be,Deceived,by,Visual,Illusions"

Accelerated gradient descent converges faster and   performs a more robust local search of the parameter space by   initially overshooting then oscillating back into minimizers which   have a basis of attraction large enough to contain the overshoot.   Recent work has demonstrated how a broad class of accelerated   schemes can be cast in a variational framework leading to continuum   limit ODE's.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate the illuminant chromaticity of AC light source using high-speed camera. We found that the temporal observations of an image pixel at a fixed location distribute on an identical dichromatic plane. Instead of spatial pixels with high specularity, multiple temporal samples of a pixel are exploited to determine AC pixels for dichromatic plane estimation, whose pixel intensity is sinusoidally  varying well. A dichromatic plane is calculated per each AC pixel, and illuminant chromaticity is determined by the intersection of dichromatic planes. From multiple dichromatic planes, an optimal illuminant is estimated with a novel MAP framework. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms both existing dichromatic based methods and temporal color constancy methods, irrespective of the amount of specularity.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dichromatic,Model,Based,Temporal,Color,Constancy,for,AC,Light,Sources"

SAM-Net accomplishes this through an iterative process of establishing reliable correspondences by reducing the attribute discrepancy between the images and synthesizing attribute transferred images using the learned correspondences. To learn the networks using weak supervisions in the form of image pairs, we present a semantic attribute matching loss based on the matching similarity between an attribute transferred source feature and a warped target feature.

In this paper, we aim to predict affordances of 3D indoor scenes, specifically what human poses are afforded by a given indoor environment, such as sitting on a chair or standing on the floor. In order to predict valid affordances and learn possible 3D human poses in indoor scenes, we need to understand the semantic and geometric structure of a scene as well as its potential interactions with a human. To learn such a model, a large-scale dataset of 3D indoor affordances is required. In this work, we build a fully automatic 3D pose synthesizer that fuses semantic knowledge from a large number of 2D poses extracted from TV shows as well as 3D geometric knowledge from voxel representations of indoor scenes. With the data created by the synthesizer, we introduce a 3D pose generative model to predict semantically plausible and physically feasible human poses within a given scene (provided as a single RGB, RGB-D, or depth image). We demonstrate that our human affordance prediction method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Putting,Humans,in,a,Scene:,Learning,Affordance,in,3D,Indoor,Environments"
394,PIEs: Pose Invariant Embeddings,"The role of pose invariance in image recognition and retrieval is studied. A taxonomic classification of embeddings, according to their level of invariance, is introduced and used to clarify connections between existing embeddings, identify missing approaches, and propose invariant generalizations. This leads to a new family of pose invariant embeddings (PIEs), derived from existing approaches by a combination of two models, which follow from the interpretation of CNNs as estimators of class posterior probabilities: a view-to-object model and an object-to-class model. The new pose-invariant models are shown to have interesting properties, both theoretically and through experiments, where they outperform existing multiview approaches. Most notably, they achieve good performance for both 1) classification and retrieval, and 2) single and multiview inference. These are important properties for the design of real vision systems, where universal embeddings are preferable to task specific ones, and multiple images are usually not available at inference time. Finally, a new multiview dataset of real objects, imaged in the wild against complex backgrounds, is introduced. We believe that this is a much needed complement to the synthetic datasets in wide use and will contribute to the advancement of multiview recognition and retrieval.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PIEs:,Pose,Invariant,Embeddings"
395,Representation Similarity Analysis for Efficient Task Taxonomy & Transfer Learning,"Transfer learning is widely used in deep neural network models when there are few labeled examples available. The common approach is to take a pre-trained network in a similar task and finetune the model parameters. This is usually done blindly without a pre-selection from a set of pre-trained models, or by finetuning a set of models trained on different tasks and selecting the best performing one by cross-validation.  We address this problem by proposing an approach to assess the relationship between visual tasks and their task-specific models. Our method uses Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA), which is commonly used to find a correlation between neuronal responses from brain data and models. With RSA we obtain a similarity score among tasks by computing correlations between models trained on different tasks. Our method is efficient as it requires only pre-trained models, and a few images with no further training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method to generating task taxonomy on Taskonomy dataset.  We next evaluate the relationship of RSA with the transfer learning performance on Taskonomy tasks and a new task: Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. Our results reveal that models trained on tasks with higher similarity score show higher transfer learning performance. Surprisingly, the best transfer learning result for Pascal VOC semantic segmentation is not obtained from the pre-trained model on semantic segmentation, probably due to the domain differences, and our method successfully selects the high performing models.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Representation,Similarity,Analysis,for,Efficient,Task,Taxonomy,&,Transfer,Learning"
396,Object Counting and Instance Segmentation With Image-Level Supervision,"Common object counting in a natural scene is a challenging problem in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. Existing image-level supervised common object counting approaches only predict the global object count and rely on additional instance-level supervision to also determine object locations. We propose an image-level supervised approach that provides both the global object count and the spatial distribution of object instances by constructing an object category density map. Motivated by psychological studies, we further reduce image-level supervision using a limited object count information (up to four). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose image-level supervised density map estimation for common object counting and demonstrate its effectiveness in image-level supervised instance segmentation.  Comprehensive experiments are performed on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. Our approach outperforms existing methods, including those using instance-level supervision, on both datasets for common object counting. Moreover, our approach  improves state-of-the-art image-level supervised instance segmentation with a relative gain of 17.8% in terms of average best overlap, on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Object,Counting,and,Instance,Segmentation,With,Image-Level,Supervision"
397,Variational Autoencoders Pursue PCA Directions (by Accident),"The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a powerful architecture capable of representation learning and generative modeling. When it comes to learning interpretable (disentangled) representations, VAE and its variants show unparalleled performance. However, the reasons for this are unclear, since a very particular alignment of the latent embedding is needed but the design of the VAE does not encourage it in any explicit way. We address this matter and offer the following explanation: the diagonal approximation in the encoder together with the inherent stochasticity force local orthogonality of the decoder. The local behavior of promoting both reconstruction and orthogonality matches closely how the PCA embedding is chosen. Alongside providing an intuitive understanding, we justify the statement with full theoretical analysis as well as with experiments.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Variational,Autoencoders,Pursue,PCA,Directions,(by,Accident)"
398,A Relation-Augmented Fully Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Scenes,"Most current semantic segmentation approaches fall back on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, their use of convolution operations with local receptive fields causes failures in modeling contextual spatial relations. Prior works have sought to address this issue by using graphical models or spatial propagation modules in networks. But such models often fail to capture long-range spatial relationships between entities, which leads to spatially fragmented predictions. Moreover, recent works have demonstrated that channel-wise information also acts a pivotal part in CNNs. In this work, we introduce two simple yet effective network units, the spatial relation module and the channel relation module, to learn and reason about global relationships between any two spatial positions or feature maps, and then produce relation-augmented feature representations. The spatial and channel relation modules are general and extensible, and can be used in a plug-and-play fashion with the existing fully convolutional network (FCN) framework. We evaluate relation module-equipped networks on semantic segmentation tasks using two aerial image datasets, which fundamentally depend on long-range spatial relational reasoning. The networks achieve very competitive results, bringing significant improvements over baselines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Relation-Augmented,Fully,Convolutional,Network,for,Semantic,Segmentation,in,Aerial,Scenes"
399,Temporal Transformer Networks: Joint Learning of Invariant and Discriminative Time Warping,"Many time-series classification problems involve developing metrics that are invariant to temporal misalignment. In human activity analysis, temporal misalignment arises due to various reasons including differing initial phase, sensor sampling rates, and elastic time-warps due to subject-specific biomechanics. Past work in this area has only looked at reducing intra-class variability by elastic temporal alignment. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model-based and data-driven approach to learn warping functions that not just reduce intra-class variability, but also  increase inter-class separation. We call this a temporal transformer network (TTN). TTN is an interpretable differentiable module, which can be easily integrated at the front end of a classification network. The module is capable of reducing intra-class variance by generating input-dependent warping functions which lead to rate-robust representations. At the same time, it increases inter-class variance by learning warping functions that are more discriminative. We show improvements over strong baselines in 3D action recognition on challenging datasets using the proposed framework. The improvements are especially pronounced when training sets are smaller.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Temporal,Transformer,Networks:,Joint,Learning,of,Invariant,and,Discriminative,Time,Warping"

The main challenge is how to find an efficient way to encode the local features into a discriminative global descriptor. In this paper, we propose a Point Contextual Attention Network (PCAN), which can predict the significance of each local point feature based on point context. Our network makes it possible to pay more attention to the task-relevent features when aggregating local features. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed network can provide outperformance than current state-of-the-art approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PCAN:,3D,Attention,Map,Learning,Using,Contextual,Information,for,Point,Cloud,Based,Retrieval"
401,Depth Coefficients for Depth Completion,"Depth completion involves estimating a dense depth image from sparse depth measurements, often guided by a color image.  While linear upsampling is straight forward, it results in depth pixels being interpolated in empty space across discontinuities between objects.  Current methods use deep networks to maintain gaps between objects.  Nevertheless depth smearing remains a challenge.  We propose a new representation for depth called Depth Coefficients (DC) to address this problem.  It enables convolutions to more easily avoid inter-object depth mixing. We also show that the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function can promote depth mixing, and so we propose instead to use cross-entropy loss for DC. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation are conducted on benchmarks, and we show that switching out sparse depth input and MSE loss functions with our DC representation and loss is a simple way to improve performance, reduce pixel depth mixing and can improve object detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Depth,Coefficients,for,Depth,Completion"
402,Diversify and Match: A Domain Adaptive Representation Learning Paradigm for Object Detection,"We introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach for object detection. We aim to alleviate the imperfect translation problem of pixel-level adaptations, and the source-biased discriminativity problem of feature-level adaptations simultaneously. Our approach is composed of two stages, i.e., Domain Diversification (DD) and Multi-domain-invariant Representation Learning (MRL). At the DD stage, we diversify the distribution of the labeled data by generating various distinctive shifted domains from the source domain. At the MRL stage, we apply adversarial learning with a multi-domain discriminator to encourage feature to be indistinguishable among the domains. DD addresses the source-biased discriminativity, while MRL mitigates the imperfect image translation. We construct a structured domain adaptation framework for our learning paradigm and introduce a practical way of DD for implementation. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of 3% 11% in terms of mean average precision (mAP) on various datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Diversify,and,Match:,A,Domain,Adaptive,Representation,Learning,Paradigm,for,Object,Detection"
403,"Good News, Everyone! Context Driven Entity-Aware Captioning for News Images","Current image captioning systems perform at a merely descriptive level, essentially enumerating the objects in the scene and their relations. Humans, on the contrary, interpret images by integrating several sources of prior knowledge of the world. In this work, we aim to take a step closer to producing captions that offer a plausible interpretation of the scene, by integrating such contextual information into the captioning pipeline. For this we focus on the captioning of images used to illustrate news articles. We propose a novel captioning method that is able to leverage contextual information provided by the text of news articles associated with an image. Our model is able to selectively draw information from the article guided by visual cues, and to dynamically extend the output dictionary to out-of-vocabulary named entities that appear in the context source. Furthermore we introduce ""GoodNews"", the largest news image captioning dataset in the literature and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Good,News,,Everyone!,Context,Driven,Entity-Aware,Captioning,for,News,Images"
404,Multi-Level Multimodal Common Semantic Space for Image-Phrase Grounding,"We address the problem of phrase grounding by learning a multi-level common semantic space shared by the textual and visual modalities. We exploit multiple levels of feature maps of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, as well as contextualized word and sentence embeddings extracted from a character-based language model. Following dedicated non-linear mappings for visual features at each level, word, and sentence embeddings, we obtain multiple instantiations of our common semantic space in which comparisons between any target text and the visual content is performed with cosine similarity. We guide the model by a multi-level multimodal attention mechanism which outputs attended visual features at each level. The best level is chosen to be compared with text content for maximizing the pertinence scores of image-sentence pairs of the ground truth. Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets show significant performance gains (20%-60% relative) over the state-of-the-art in phrase localization and set a new performance record on those datasets. We provide a detailed ablation study to show the contribution of each element of our approach and release our code on GitHub.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Level,Multimodal,Common,Semantic,Space,for,Image-Phrase,Grounding"
405,Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Semantic Attribute Enriched Visual Encoding for Video Captioning,"Automatic generation of video captions is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent techniques typically employ a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) for video captioning. These methods mainly focus on tailoring sequence learning through RNNs for better caption generation, whereas off-the-shelf visual features are borrowed from CNNs. We argue that careful designing of visual features for this task is equally important, and present a visual feature encoding technique to generate semantically rich captions using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our method embeds rich temporal dynamics in visual features by hierarchically applying Short Fourier Transform to CNN features of the whole video. It additionally derives high level semantics from an object detector to enrich the representation with spatial dynamics of the detected objects. The final representation is projected to a compact space and fed to a language model. By learning a relatively simple language model comprising two GRU layers, we establish new state-of-the-art on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets for METEOR and ROUGE_L metrics.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spatio-Temporal,Dynamics,and,Semantic,Attribute,Enriched,Visual,Encoding,for,Video,Captioning"
406,Pointing Novel Objects in Image Captioning,"Image captioning has received significant attention with remarkable improvements in recent advances. Nevertheless, images in the wild encapsulate rich knowledge and cannot be sufficiently described with models built on image-caption pairs containing only in-domain objects. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by augmenting standard deep captioning architectures with object learners. Specifically, we present Long Short-Term Memory with Pointing (LSTM-P) --- a new architecture that facilitates vocabulary expansion and produces novel objects via pointing mechanism. Technically, object learners are initially pre-trained on available object recognition data. Pointing in LSTM-P then balances the probability between generating a word through LSTM and copying a word from the recognized objects at each time step in decoder stage. Furthermore, our captioning encourages global coverage of objects in the sentence. Extensive experiments are conducted on both held-out COCO image captioning and ImageNet datasets for describing novel objects, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, we obtain an average of 60.9% in F1 score on held-out COCO dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pointing,Novel,Objects,in,Image,Captioning"
407,Informative Object Annotations: Tell Me Something I Don't Know,"Capturing the interesting components of an image is a key aspect of image understanding. When a speaker annotates an image, selecting labels that are informative  greatly depends on the prior knowledge of a prospective listener. Motivated by cognitive theories of categorization and communication, we present a new unsupervised approach to model this prior knowledge and quantify the informativeness of a description. Specifically, we compute how knowledge of a label reduces uncertainty over the space of labels and use this uncertainty reduction to rank candidate labels for describing an image. While the full estimation problem is intractable, we describe an efficient algorithm to approximate entropy reduction using a tree-structured graphical model. We evaluate our approach on the open-images dataset using a new evaluation set of 10K ground-truth ratings and find that it achieves over 65% agreement with human raters, close to the upper bound of inter-rater agreement and largely outperforming other unsupervised baseline approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Informative,Object,Annotations:,Tell,Me,Something,I,Don't,Know"
408,Engaging Image Captioning via Personality,"Standard image captioning tasks such as COCO and Flickr30k are factual, neutral in tone and (to a human) state the obvious (e.g., ""a man playing a guitar""). While such tasks are useful to verify that a machine understands the content of an image, they are not engaging to humans as captions. With this in mind we define a new task, PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS, where the goal is to be as engaging to humans as possible by incorporating controllable style and personality traits. We collect and release a large dataset of 241,858 of such captions conditioned over 215 possible traits. We build models that combine existing work from (i) sentence representations [36] with Transformers trained on 1.7 billion dialogue examples; and (ii) image representations [32] with ResNets trained on 3.5 billion social media images. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30k and COCO, and strong performance on our new task.

The task emulates a real-world scenario in that (a) the requester may not know how to navigate to the target objects and thus makes requests by only specifying high-level end-goals, and (b) the agent is capable of sensing when it is lost and querying an advisor, who is more qualified at the task, to obtain language subgoals to make progress. To model language-based assistance, we develop a general framework termed Imitation Learning with Indirect Intervention (I3L), and propose a solution that is effective on the VNLA task.

Therefore, in this paper, we provide and carefully analyze a simple baseline for audio-visual scene-aware dialog which is trained end-to-end. Our method differentiates in a data-driven manner useful signals from distracting ones using an attention mechanism. We evaluate the proposed approach on the recently introduced and challenging audio-visual scene-aware dataset, and demonstrate the key features that permit to outperform the current state-of-the-art by more than 20% on CIDEr.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Simple,Baseline,for,Audio-Visual,Scene-Aware,Dialog"

413,Efficient Neural Network Compression,"Network compression reduces the computational complexity and memory consumption of deep neural networks by reducing the number of parameters. In SVD-based network compression the right rank needs to be decided for every layer of the network. In this paper we propose an efficient method for obtaining the rank configuration of the whole network. Unlike previous methods which consider each layer separately, our method considers the whole network to choose the right rank configuration. We propose novel accuracy metrics to represent the accuracy and complexity relationship for a given neural network. We use these metrics in a non-iterative fashion to obtain the right rank configuration which satisfies the constraints on FLOPs and memory while maintaining sufficient accuracy. Experiments show that our method provides better compromise between accuracy and computational complexity/memory consumption while performing compression at much higher speed. For VGG-16 our network can reduce the FLOPs by 25% and improve accuracy by 0.7% compared to the baseline, while requiring only 3 minutes on a CPU to search for the right rank configuration. Previously, similar results were achieved in 4 hours with 8 GPUs. The proposed method can be used for lossless compression of a neural network as well.

414,Cascaded Generative and Discriminative Learning for Microcalcification Detection in Breast Mammograms,"Accurate microcalcification (mC) detection is of great importance due to its high proportion in early breast cancers. Most of the previous mC detection methods belong to discriminative models, where classifiers are exploited to distinguish mCs from other backgrounds. However, it is still challenging for these methods to tell the mCs from amounts of normal tissues because they are too tiny (at most 14 pixels). Generative methods can precisely model the normal tissues and regard the abnormal ones as outliers, while they fail to further distinguish the mCs from other anomalies, i.e. vessel calcifications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach by taking advantages of both generative and discriminative models. Firstly, a generative model named Anomaly Separation Network (ASN) is used to generate candidate mCs. ASN contains two major components. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder network is built to learn the image reconstruction mapping and a t-test loss function is designed to separate the distributions of the reconstruction residuals of mCs from normal tissues. Secondly, a discriminative model is cascaded to tell the mCs from the false positives. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public and in-house datasets, which demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cascaded,Generative,and,Discriminative,Learning,for,Microcalcification,Detection,in,Breast,Mammograms"
415,C3AE: Exploring the Limits of Compact Model for Age Estimation,"Age estimation is a classic learning problem in computer vision. Many larger and deeper CNNs have been proposed with promising performance, such as AlexNet, VggNet, GoogLeNet and ResNet. However, these models are not practical for the embedded/mobile devices. Recently, MobileNets and ShuffleNets have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters, yielding lightweight models. However, their representation has been weakened because of the adoption of depth-wise separable convolution. In this work, we investigate the limits of compact model for small-scale image and propose an extremely Compact yet efficient Cascade Context-based Age Estimation model(C3AE). This model possesses only 1/9 and 1/2000 parameters compared with MobileNets/ShuffleNets and VggNet, while achieves competitive performance. In particular, we re-define age estimation problem by two-points representation, which is implemented by a cascade model. Moreover, to fully utilize the facial context information, multi-branch CNN network is proposed to aggregate multi-scale context. Experiments are carried out on three age estimation datasets.

For pathological diagnosis of cancer subtypes, pathologists usually change the magnification of whole-slide images (WSI) viewers. A key assumption is that the importance of the magnifications depends on the characteristics of the input image, such as cancer subtypes. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation method, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can adaptively use image features from images with different magnifications to segment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed method aggregates several expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by adaptively changing the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It leverages information in the images with different magnifications that might be useful for identifying the subtypes.

Many of these applications involve real-time prediction on mobile platforms such as cars, drones and various kinds of robots. Real-time setup is challenging due to extraordinary computational complexity involved. Many previous works address the challenge with custom lightweight architectures which decrease computational complexity by reducing depth, width and layer capacity with respect to general purpose architectures. We propose an alternative approach which achieves a significantly better performance across a wide range of computing budgets. First, we rely on a light-weight general purpose architecture as the main recognition engine. Then, we leverage light-weight upsampling with lateral connections as the most cost-effective solution to restore the prediction resolution. Finally, we propose to enlarge the receptive field by fusing shared features at multiple resolutions in a novel fashion. Experiments on several road driving datasets show a substantial advantage of the proposed approach, either with ImageNet pre-trained parameters or when we learn from scratch.

Part of the answer lies in understanding of visual aesthetics, and is biased by personal preferences shaped by social attitudes, time, and place.  In this work we propose a method that predicts compatibility between two items based on their visual features, as well as their context. We define context as the products that are known to be compatible with each of these item. Our model is in contrast to other metric learning approaches that rely on pairwise comparisons between item features alone. We address the compatibility prediction problem using a graph neural network that learns to generate product embeddings conditioned on their context. We present results for two prediction tasks (fill in the blank and outfit compatibility) tested on two fashion datasets Polyvore and Fashion-Gen, and on a subset of the Amazon dataset; we achieve state of the art results when using context information and show how test performance improves as more context is used.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Context-Aware,Visual,Compatibility,Prediction"
419,Sim-To-Real via Sim-To-Sim: Data-Efficient Robotic Grasping via Randomized-To-Canonical Adaptation Networks,"Real world data, especially in the domain of robotics, is notoriously costly to collect. One way to circumvent this can be to leverage the power of simulation to produce large amounts of labelled data. However, training models on simulated images does not readily transfer to real-world ones. Using domain adaptation methods to cross this ""reality gap"" requires a large amount of unlabelled real-world data, whilst domain randomization alone can waste modeling power. In this paper, we present Randomized-to-Canonical Adaptation Networks (RCANs), a novel approach to crossing the visual reality gap that uses no real-world data. Our method learns to translate randomized rendered images into their equivalent non-randomized, canonical versions. This in turn allows for real images to also be translated into canonical sim images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this sim-to-real approach by training a vision-based closed-loop grasping reinforcement learning agent in simulation, and then transferring it to the real world to attain 70% zero-shot grasp success on unseen objects, a result that almost doubles the success of learning the same task directly on domain randomization alone. Additionally, by joint finetuning in the real-world with only 5,000 real-world grasps, our method achieves 91%, attaining comparable performance to a state-of-the-art system trained with 580,000 real-world grasps, resulting in a reduction of real-world data by more than 99%.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Sim-To-Real,via,Sim-To-Sim:,Data-Efficient,Robotic,Grasping,via,Randomized-To-Canonical,Adaptation,Networks"
420,Multiview 2D/3D Rigid Registration via a Point-Of-Interest Network for Tracking and Triangulation,"We propose to tackle the problem of multiview 2D/3D rigid registration for intervention via a Point-Of-Interest Network for Tracking and Triangulation (POINT^2). POINT^2 learns to establish 2D point-to-point correspondences between the pre- and intra-intervention images by tracking a set of random POIs. The 3D pose of the pre-intervention volume is then estimated through a triangulation layer. In POINT^2, the unified framework of the POI tracker and the triangulation layer enables learning informative 2D features and estimating 3D pose jointly. In contrast to existing approaches, POINT^2 only requires a single forward-pass to achieve a reliable 2D/3D registration. As the POI tracker is shift-invariant, POINT^2 is more robust to the initial pose of the 3D pre-intervention image. Extensive experiments on a large-scale clinical cone-beam CT (CBCT) dataset show that the proposed POINT^2 method outperforms the existing learning-based method in terms of accuracy, robustness and running time. Furthermore, when used as an initial pose estimator, our method also improves the robustness and speed of the state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches by ten folds.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multiview,2D/3D,Rigid,Registration,via,a,Point-Of-Interest,Network,for,Tracking,and,Triangulation"
421,Context-Aware Spatio-Recurrent Curvilinear Structure Segmentation,"Curvilinear structures are frequently observed in various images in different forms, such as blood vessels or neuronal boundaries in biomedical images. In this paper, we propose a novel curvilinear structure segmentation approach using context-aware spatio-recurrent networks. Instead of directly segmenting the whole image or densely segmenting fixed-sized local patches, our method recurrently samples patches with varied scales from the target image with learned policy and processes them locally, which is similar to the behavior of changing retinal fixations in the human visual system and it is beneficial for capturing the multi-scale or hierarchical modality of the complex curvilinear structures.  In specific, the policy of choosing local patches is attentively learned based on the contextual information of the image and the historical sampling experience.   In this way, with more patches sampled and refined, the segmentation of the whole image can be progressively improved. To validate our approach, comparison experiments on different types of image data are conducted and the sampling procedures for exemplar images are illustrated. We demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in public datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Context-Aware,Spatio-Recurrent,Curvilinear,Structure,Segmentation"
422,An Alternative Deep Feature Approach to Line Level Keyword Spotting,"Keyword  spotting  (KWS)  is  defined  as  the  problem  of detecting  all  instances  of  a  given  word,  provided  by  the user  either  as  a  query  word  image (Query-by-Example, QbE) or a query word string (Query-by-String, QbS) in a body  of  digitized  documents.   Keyword  detection  is  typically preceded by a preprocessing step where the text is segmented into text lines (line-level KWS). Methods following this  paradigm  are  monopolized  by  test-time  computationally  expensive  handwritten  text  recognition  (HTR)-based approaches; furthermore, they typically cannot handle image  queries  (QbE). In  this  work,  we  propose  a  time  and storage-efficient, deep feature-based approach that enables both the image and textual search options. Three distinct components, all modeled as neural networks, are combined: normalization, feature extraction and representation of image  and  textual  input  into  a  common  space. These  components, even if designed on word level image representations, collaborate in order to achieve an efficient line level keyword spotting system. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system is on par with state-of-the-art KWS methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"An,Alternative,Deep,Feature,Approach,to,Line,Level,Keyword,Spotting"
423,Dynamics Are Important for the Recognition of Equine Pain in Video,"A prerequisite to successfully alleviate pain in animals is to recognize it, which is a great challenge in non-verbal species. Furthermore, prey animals such as horses tend to hide their pain. In this study, we propose a deep recurrent two-stream architecture for the task of distinguishing pain from non-pain in videos of horses. Different models are evaluated on a unique dataset showing horses under controlled trials with moderate pain induction, which has been presented in earlier work. Sequential models are experimentally compared to single-frame models, showing the importance of the temporal dimension of the data, and are benchmarked against a veterinary expert classification of the data. We additionally perform baseline comparisons with generalized versions of state-of-the-art human pain recognition methods. While equine pain detection in machine learning is a novel field, our results surpass veterinary expert performance and outperform pain detection results reported for other larger non-human species.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dynamics,Are,Important,for,the,Recognition,of,Equine,Pain,in,Video"
424,LaserNet: An Efficient Probabilistic 3D Object Detector for Autonomous Driving,"In this paper, we present LaserNet, a computationally efficient method for 3D object detection from LiDAR data for autonomous driving. The efficiency results from processing LiDAR data in the native range view of the sensor, where the input data is naturally compact. Operating in the range view involves well known challenges for learning, including occlusion and scale variation, but it also provides contextual information based on how the sensor data was captured. Our approach uses a fully convolutional network to predict a multimodal distribution over 3D boxes for each point and then it efficiently fuses these distributions to generate a prediction for each object. Experiments show that modeling each detection as a distribution rather than a single deterministic box leads to better overall detection performance. Benchmark results show that this approach has significantly lower runtime than other recent detectors and that it achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared on a large dataset that has enough data to overcome the challenges of training on the range view.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LaserNet:,An,Efficient,Probabilistic,3D,Object,Detector,for,Autonomous,Driving"
425,Machine Vision Guided 3D Medical Image Compression for Efficient Transmission and Accurate Segmentation in the Clouds,"Cloud based medical image analysis has become popular recently due to the high computation complexities of various deep neural network (DNN) based frameworks and the increasingly large volume of medical images that need to be processed. It has been demonstrated that for medical images the transmission from local to clouds is much more expensive than the computation in the clouds itself. Towards this, 3D image compression techniques have been widely applied to reduce the data traffic. However, most of the existing image compression techniques are developed around human vision, i.e., they are designed to minimize distortions that can be perceived by human eyes. In this paper, we will use deep learning based medical image segmentation as a vehicle and demonstrate that interestingly, machine and human view the compression quality differently. Medical images compressed with good quality w.r.t. human vision may result in inferior segmentation accuracy. We then design a machine vision oriented 3D image compression framework tailored for segmentation using DNNs. Our method automatically extracts and retains image features that are most important to the segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on widely adopted segmentation frameworks with HVSMR 2016 challenge dataset show that our method can achieve significantly higher segmentation accuracy at the same compression rate, or much better compression rate under the same segmentation accuracy, when compared with the existing JPEG 2000 method. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first machine vision guided medical image compression framework for segmentation in the clouds.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Machine,Vision,Guided,3D,Medical,Image,Compression,for,Efficient,Transmission,and,Accurate,Segmentation,in,the,Clouds"
426,PointPillars: Fast Encoders for Object Detection From Point Clouds,"Object detection in point clouds is an important aspect of many robotics applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider the problem of encoding a point cloud into a format appropriate for a downstream detection pipeline. Recent literature suggests two types of encoders; fixed encoders tend to be fast but sacrifice accuracy, while encoders that are learned from data are more accurate, but slower. In this work, we propose PointPillars, a novel encoder which utilizes PointNets to learn a representation of point clouds organized in vertical columns (pillars). While the encoded features can be used with any standard 2D convolutional detection architecture, we further propose a lean downstream network. Extensive experimentation shows that PointPillars outperforms previous encoders with respect to both speed and accuracy by a large margin. Despite only using lidar, our full detection pipeline significantly outperforms the state of the art, even among fusion methods, with respect to both the 3D and bird's eye view KITTI benchmarks. This detection performance is achieved while running at 62 Hz: a 2 - 4 fold runtime improvement. A faster version of our method matches the state of the art at 105 Hz. These benchmarks suggest that PointPillars is an appropriate encoding for object detection in point clouds.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PointPillars:,Fast,Encoders,for,Object,Detection,From,Point,Clouds"
427,Motion Estimation of Non-Holonomic Ground Vehicles From a Single Feature Correspondence Measured Over N Views,"The planar motion of ground vehicles is often non-holonomic, which enables a solution of the two-view relative pose problem from a single point feature correspondence. Man-made environments such as underground parking lots are however dominated by line features. Inspired by the planar tri-focal tensor and its ability to handle lines, we establish an n-linear constraint on the locally circular motion of non-holonomic vehicles able to handle an arbitrarily large and dense window of views. We prove that this stays a uni-variate problem under the assumption of locally constant vehicle speed, and it can transparently handle both point and vertical line correspondences. In particular, we prove that an application of Viete's formulas for extrapolating trigonometric functions of angle multiples and the Weierstrass substitution casts the problem as one that merely seeks the roots of a uni-variate polynomial. We present the complete theory of this novel solver, and test it on both simulated and real data. Our results prove that it successfully handles a variety of relevant scenarios, eventually outperforming the 1-point two-view solver.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Motion,Estimation,of,Non-Holonomic,Ground,Vehicles,From,a,Single,Feature,Correspondence,Measured,Over,N,Views"
428,From Coarse to Fine: Robust Hierarchical Localization at Large Scale,"Robust and accurate visual localization is a fundamental capability for numerous applications, such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, or augmented reality. It remains, however, a challenging task, particularly for large-scale environments and in presence of significant appearance changes. State-of-the-art methods not only struggle with such scenarios, but are often too resource intensive for certain real-time applications. In this paper we propose HF-Net, a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that simultaneously predicts local features and global descriptors for accurate 6-DoF localization. We exploit the coarse-to-fine localization paradigm: we first perform a global retrieval to obtain location hypotheses and only later match local features within those candidate places. This hierarchical approach incurs significant runtime savings and makes our system suitable for real-time operation. By leveraging learned descriptors, our method achieves remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance and sets a new state-of-the-art on two challenging benchmarks for large-scale localization.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"From,Coarse,to,Fine:,Robust,Hierarchical,Localization,at,Large,Scale"
429,Large Scale High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping With Multi-Resolution Data,"In this paper we propose multi-resolution data fusion methods for deep learning-based high-resolution land cover mapping from aerial imagery. The land cover mapping problem, at country-level scales, is challenging for common deep learning methods due to the scarcity of high-resolution labels, as well as variation in geography and quality of input images. On the other hand, multiple satellite imagery and low-resolution ground truth label sources are widely available, and can be used to improve model training efforts. Our methods include: introducing low-resolution satellite data to smooth quality differences in high-resolution input, exploiting low-resolution labels with a dual loss function, and pairing scarce high-resolution labels with inputs from several points in time. We train models that are able to generalize from a portion of the Northeast United States, where we have high-resolution land cover labels, to the rest of the US. With these models, we produce the first high-resolution (1-meter) land cover map of the contiguous US, consisting of over 8 trillion pixels. We demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of this data in a case study with domain experts and develop a web application to share our results. This work is practically useful, and can be applied to other locations over the earth as high-resolution imagery becomes more widely available even as high-resolution labeled land cover data remains sparse.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Large,Scale,High-Resolution,Land,Cover,Mapping,With,Multi-Resolution,Data"
430,Leveraging Heterogeneous Auxiliary Tasks to Assist Crowd Counting,"Crowd counting is a challenging task in the presence of drastic scale variations, the clutter background, and severe occlusions, etc. Existing CNN-based counting methods tackle these challenges mainly by fusing either multi-scale or multi-context features to generate robust representations. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by leveraging the heterogeneous attributes compounded in the density map. We identify three geometric/semantic/numeric attributes essentially important to the density estimation, and demonstrate how to effectively utilize these heterogeneous attributes to assist the crowd counting by formulating them into multiple auxiliary tasks. With the multi-fold regularization effects induced by the auxiliary tasks, the backbone CNN model is driven to embed desired properties explicitly and thus gains robust representations towards more accurate density estimation. Extensive experiments on three challenging crowd counting datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Leveraging,Heterogeneous,Auxiliary,Tasks,to,Assist,Crowd,Counting"
