0,Learning Video Representations From Correspondence Proposals,"Correspondences between frames encode rich information about dynamic content in videos. However, it is challenging to effectively capture and learn those due to their irregular structure and complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network that learns video representations by aggregating information from potential correspondences. This network, named CPNet, can learn evolving 2D fields with temporal consistency. In particular, it can effectively learn representations for videos by mixing appearance and long-range motion with an RGB-only input. We provide extensive ablation experiments to validate our model. CPNet shows stronger performance than existing methods on Kinetics and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Something-Something and Jester. We provide analysis towards the behavior of our model and show its robustness to errors in proposals.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Video,Representations,From,Correspondence,Proposals"
1,SiamRPN++: Evolution of Siamese Visual Tracking With Very Deep Networks,"Siamese network based trackers formulate tracking as convolutional feature cross-correlation between target template and searching region. However, Siamese trackers still have accuracy gap compared with state-of-the-art algorithms and they cannot take advantage of feature from deep networks, such as ResNet-50 or deeper. In this work we prove the core reason comes from the lack of strict translation invariance. By comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental validations, we break this restriction through a simple yet effective spatial aware sampling strategy and successfully train a ResNet-driven Siamese tracker with significant performance gain. Moreover, we propose a new model architecture to perform depth-wise and layer-wise aggregations, which not only further improves the accuracy but also reduces the model size. We conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracker, which obtains currently the best results on four large tracking benchmarks, including OTB2015, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT. Our model will be released to facilitate further studies based on this problem.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SiamRPN++:,Evolution,of,Siamese,Visual,Tracking,With,Very,Deep,Networks"
2,Sphere Generative Adversarial Network Based on Geometric Moment Matching,"We propose sphere generative adversarial network (GAN), a novel integral probability metric (IPM)-based GAN. Sphere GAN uses the hypersphere to bound IPMs in the objective function. Thus, it can be trained stably. On the hypersphere, sphere GAN exploits the information of higher-order statistics of data using geometric moment matching, thereby providing more accurate results. In the paper, we mathematically prove the good properties of sphere GAN. In experiments, sphere GAN quantitatively and qualitatively surpasses recent state-of-the-art GANs for unsupervised image generation problems with the CIFAR-10, STL-10, and LSUN bedroom datasets.

3,Adversarial Attacks Beyond the Image Space,"Generating adversarial examples is an intriguing problem and an important way of understanding the working mechanism of deep neural networks. Most existing approaches generated perturbations in the image space, i.e., each pixel can be modified independently. However, in this paper we pay special attention to the subset of adversarial examples that correspond to meaningful changes in 3D physical properties (like rotation and translation, illumination condition, etc.). These adversaries arguably pose a more serious concern, as they demonstrate the possibility of causing neural network failure by easy perturbations of real-world 3D objects and scenes.  In the contexts of object classification and visual question answering, we augment state-of-the-art deep neural networks that receive 2D input images with a rendering module (either differentiable or not) in front, so that a 3D scene (in the physical space) is rendered into a 2D image (in the image space), and then mapped to a prediction (in the output space). The adversarial perturbations can now go beyond the image space, and have clear meanings in the 3D physical world. Though image-space adversaries can be interpreted as per-pixel albedo change, we verify that they cannot be well explained along these physically meaningful dimensions, which often have a non-local effect. But it is still possible to successfully attack beyond the image space on the physical space, though this is more difficult than image-space attacks, reflected in lower success rates and heavier perturbations required.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Adversarial,Attacks,Beyond,the,Image,Space"
4,Evading Defenses to Transferable Adversarial Examples by Translation-Invariant Attacks,"Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can mislead classifiers by adding imperceptible perturbations. An intriguing property of adversarial examples is their good transferability, making black-box attacks feasible in real-world applications. Due to the threat of adversarial attacks, many methods have been proposed to improve the robustness. Several state-of-the-art defenses are shown to be robust against transferable adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose a translation-invariant attack method to generate more transferable adversarial examples against the defense models. By optimizing a perturbation over an ensemble of translated images, the generated adversarial example is less sensitive to the white-box model being attacked and has better transferability. To improve the efficiency of attacks, we further show that our method can be implemented by convolving the gradient at the untranslated image with a pre-defined kernel. Our method is generally applicable to any gradient-based attack method. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our best attack fools eight state-of-the-art defenses at an 82% success rate on average based only on the transferability, demonstrating the insecurity of the current defense techniques.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Evading,Defenses,to,Transferable,Adversarial,Examples,by,Translation-Invariant,Attacks"
5,Decoupling Direction and Norm for Efficient Gradient-Based L2 Adversarial Attacks and Defenses,"Research on adversarial examples in computer vision tasks has shown that small, often imperceptible changes to an image can induce misclassification, which has security implications for a wide range of image processing systems. Considering L2 norm distortions, the Carlini and Wagner attack is presently the most effective white-box attack in the literature. However, this method is slow since it performs a line-search for one of the optimization terms, and often requires thousands of iterations. In this paper, an efficient approach is proposed to generate gradient-based attacks that induce misclassifications with low L2 norm, by decoupling the direction and the norm of the adversarial perturbation that is added to the image. Experiments conducted on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that our attack achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art (in terms of L2 norm) with considerably fewer iterations (as few as 100 iterations), which opens the possibility of using these attacks for adversarial training. Models trained with our attack achieve state-of-the-art robustness against white-box gradient-based L2 attacks on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, outperforming the Madry defense when the attacks are limited to a maximum norm.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Decoupling,Direction,and,Norm,for,Efficient,Gradient-Based,L2,Adversarial,Attacks,and,Defenses"
6,A General and Adaptive Robust Loss Function,"We present a generalization of the Cauchy/Lorentzian, Geman-McClure, Welsch/Leclerc, generalized Charbonnier, Charbonnier/pseudo-Huber/L1-L2, and L2 loss functions. By introducing robustness as a continuous parameter, our loss function allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to be generalized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such as registration and clustering. Interpreting our loss as the negative log of a univariate density yields a general probability distribution that includes normal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. This probabilistic interpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustness of the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improves performance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis and unsupervised monocular depth estimation, without requiring any manual parameter tuning.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,General,and,Adaptive,Robust,Loss,Function"
7,Filter Pruning via Geometric Median for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Acceleration,"Previous works utilized ""smaller-norm-less-important"" criterion to prune filters with smaller norm values in a convolutional neural network.  In this paper, we analyze this norm-based criterion and point out that its effectiveness depends on two requirements that are not always met:  (1) the norm deviation of the filters should be large; (2) the minimum norm of the filters should be small. To solve this problem, we propose a novel filter pruning method, namely Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM), to compress the model regardless of those two requirements. Unlike previous methods, FPGM compresses CNN models by pruning filters with redundancy, rather than those with""relatively less"" importance. When applied to two image classification benchmarks, our method validates its usefulness and strengths. Notably, on CIFAR-10, FPGM reduces more than 52% FLOPs on ResNet-110 with even 2.69% relative accuracy improvement. Moreover, on ILSVRC-2012, FPGM reduces more than 42% FLOPs on ResNet-101 without top-5 accuracy drop, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

8,Learning to Quantize Deep Networks by Optimizing Quantization Intervals With Task Loss,"Reducing bit-widths of activations and weights of deep networks makes it efficient to compute and store them in memory, which is crucial in their deployments to resource-limited devices, such as mobile phones. However, decreasing bit-widths with quantization generally yields drastically degraded accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose to learn to quantize activations and weights via a trainable quantizer that transforms and discretizes them. Specifically, we parameterize the quantization intervals and obtain their optimal values by directly minimizing the task loss of the network. This quantization-interval-learning (QIL) allows the quantized networks to maintain the accuracy of the full-precision (32-bit) networks with bit-width as low as 4-bit and minimize the accuracy degeneration with further bit-width reduction (i.e., 3 and 2-bit). Moreover, our quantizer can be trained on a heterogeneous dataset, and thus can be used to quantize pretrained networks without access to their training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our trainable quantizer on ImageNet dataset with various network architectures such as ResNet-18, -34 and AlexNet, on which it outperforms existing methods to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Quantize,Deep,Networks,by,Optimizing,Quantization,Intervals,With,Task,Loss"
9,Not All Areas Are Equal: Transfer Learning for Semantic Segmentation via Hierarchical Region Selection,"The success of deep neural networks for semantic segmentation heavily relies on large-scale and well-labeled datasets, which are hard to collect in practice. Synthetic data offers an alternative to obtain ground-truth labels for free. However, models directly trained on synthetic data often struggle to generalize to real images.  In this paper, we consider transfer learning for semantic segmentation that aims to mitigate the gap between abundant synthetic data (source domain) and limited real data (target domain).  Unlike previous approaches that either learn mappings to target domain or finetune on target images, our proposed method jointly learn from real images and selectively from realistic pixels in synthetic images to adapt to the target domain.  Our key idea is to have weighting networks to score how similar the synthetic pixels are to real ones, and learn such weighting at pixel-, region- and image-levels. We jointly learn these hierarchical weighting networks and segmentation network in an end-to-end manner.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other existing baselines, and is applicable to scenarios with extremely limited real images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Not,All,Areas,Are,Equal:,Transfer,Learning,for,Semantic,Segmentation,via,Hierarchical,Region,Selection"
10,Unsupervised Learning of Dense Shape Correspondence,"We introduce the first completely unsupervised correspondence learning approach for deformable 3D shapes.  Key to our model is the understanding that natural deformations (such as changes in pose) approximately preserve the metric structure of the surface, yielding a natural criterion to drive the learning process toward distortion-minimizing predictions.  On this basis, we overcome the need for annotated data and replace it by a purely geometric criterion.  The resulting learning model is class-agnostic, and is able to leverage any type of deformable geometric data for the training phase.  In contrast to existing supervised approaches which specialize on the class seen at training time, we demonstrate stronger generalization as well as applicability to a variety of challenging settings.  We showcase our method on a wide selection of correspondence benchmarks, where we outperform other methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and efficiency.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Learning,of,Dense,Shape,Correspondence"
11,Unsupervised Visual Domain Adaptation: A Deep Max-Margin Gaussian Process Approach,"For unsupervised domain adaptation, the target domain error can be provably reduced by having a shared input representation that makes the source and target domains indistinguishable from each other. Very recently it has been shown that it is not only critical to match the marginal input distributions, but also align the output class distributions. The latter can be achieved by minimizing the maximum discrepancy of predictors. In this paper, we take this principle further by proposing a more systematic and effective way to achieve hypothesis consistency using Gaussian processes (GP). The GP allows us to induce a hypothesis space of classifiers from the posterior distribution of the latent random functions, turning the learning into a large-margin posterior separation problem, significantly easier to solve than previous approaches based on adversarial minimax optimization. We formulate a learning objective that effectively influences the posterior to minimize the maximum discrepancy. This is shown to be equivalent to maximizing margins and minimizing uncertainty of the class predictions in the target domain.  Empirical results demonstrate that our approach leads to state-to-the-art performance superior to existing methods on several challenging benchmarks for domain adaptation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Visual,Domain,Adaptation:,A,Deep,Max-Margin,Gaussian,Process,Approach"
12,Balanced Self-Paced Learning for Generative Adversarial Clustering Network,"Clustering is an important problem in various machine learning applications, but still a challenging task when dealing with complex real data. The existing clustering algorithms utilize either shallow models with insufficient capacity for capturing the non-linear nature of data, or deep models with large number of parameters prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose  a deep Generative Adversarial Clustering Network (ClusterGAN), which tackles the problems of training of deep clustering models in unsupervised manner. ClusterGAN consists of three networks, a discriminator, a generator and a clusterer (i.e. a clustering network). We employ an adversarial game between these three players to synthesize realistic samples given discriminative latent variables via the generator, and learn the inverse mapping of the real samples to the discriminative embedding space via the clusterer. Moreover, we utilize a conditional entropy minimization loss to increase/decrease the similarity of intra/inter cluster samples. Since the ground-truth similarities are unknown in clustering task, we propose a novel balanced self-paced learning algorithm to gradually include samples into training from easy to difficult, while considering the diversity of selected samples from all clusters. Therefore, our method makes it possible to efficiently train clusterers with large depth by leveraging the proposed adversarial game and balanced self-paced learning algorithm. According our experiments, ClusterGAN achieves competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art clustering and hashing models on several datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Balanced,Self-Paced,Learning,for,Generative,Adversarial,Clustering,Network"

The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture.

14,Parallel Optimal Transport GAN,"Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are known for their sharp realism in image generation, they often fail to estimate areas of the data density. This leads to low modal diversity and at times distorted generated samples. These problems essentially arise from poor estimation of the distance metric responsible for training these networks. To address these issues, we introduce an additional regularisation term which performs optimal transport in parallel within a low dimensional representation space. We demonstrate that operating in a low dimension representation of the data distribution benefits from convergence rate gains in estimating the Wasserstein distance, resulting in more stable GAN training. We empirically show that our regulariser achieves a stabilising effect which leads to higher quality of generated samples and increased mode coverage of the given data distribution.

15,3D-SIS: 3D Semantic Instance Segmentation of RGB-D Scans,"We introduce 3D-SIS, a novel neural network architecture for 3D semantic instance segmentation in commodity RGB-D scans. The core idea of our method to jointly learn from both geometric and color signal, thus enabling accurate instance predictions. Rather than operate solely on 2D frames, we observe that most computer vision applications have multi-view RGB-D input available, which we leverage to construct an approach for 3D instance segmentation that effectively fuses together these multi-modal inputs. Our network leverages high-resolution RGB input by associating 2D images with the volumetric grid based on the pose alignment of the 3D reconstruction. For each image, we first extract 2D features for each pixel with a series of 2D convolutions; we then backproject the resulting feature vector to the associated voxel in the 3D grid. This combination of 2D and 3D feature learning allows significantly higher accuracy object detection and instance segmentation than state-of-the-art alternatives. We show results on both synthetic and real-world public benchmarks, achieving an improvement in mAP of over 13 on real-world data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"3D-SIS:,3D,Semantic,Instance,Segmentation,of,RGB-D,Scans"
16,Causes and Corrections for Bimodal Multi-Path Scanning With Structured Light,"Structured light illumination is an active 3D scanning technique based on projecting/capturing a set of striped patterns and measuring the warping of the patterns as they reflect off a target object's surface. As designed, each pixel in the camera sees exactly one pixel from the projector; however, there are multi-path situations when the scanned surface has a complicated geometry with step edges and other discontinuities in depth or where the target surface has specularities that reflect light away from the camera. These situations are generally referred to multi-path where a camera pixel sees light from multiple projector positions.  In the case of bimodal multi-path, the camera pixel receives light from exactly two positions which occurs along a step edge where the edge slices through a pixel so that the pixel sees both a foreground and background surface. In this paper, we present a general mathematical model to address the bimodal multi-path issue in a phase-measuring-profilometry scanner to measure the constructive and destructive interference between the two light paths, and by taking advantage of this interesting cue, separate the paths and make two decoupled phase measurements. We validate our algorithm with  a number of challenging real-world scenarios, outperforming the state-of-the-art method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Causes,and,Corrections,for,Bimodal,Multi-Path,Scanning,With,Structured,Light"
17,TextureNet: Consistent Local Parametrizations for Learning From High-Resolution Signals on Meshes,"We introduce,  TextureNet,  a  neural network architecture designed to extract features from high-resolution signals associated with 3D surface meshes (e.g., color texture maps).  The key idea is to utilize a 4-rotational symmetric(4-RoSy) field to define a domain for convolution on a surface.  Though 4-RoSy fields have several properties favor-able for convolution on surfaces (low distortion, few singularities, consistent parameterization, etc.), orientations are ambiguous up to 4-fold rotation at any sample point.  So, we introduce a new convolutional operator invariant to the4-RoSy ambiguity and use it in a network to extract features from high-resolution signals on geodesic neighborhoods of a surface. In comparison to alternatives, such as PointNet-based methods which lack a notion of orientation, the coherent structure given by these neighborhoods results in significantly stronger features. As an example application, we demonstrate the benefits of our architecture for 3D semantic segmentation of textured 3D meshes.  The results show that our method outperforms all existing methods on the basis of mean IoU by a significant margin in both geometry-only(6.4%) and RGB+Geometry (6.9-8.2%) settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"TextureNet:,Consistent,Local,Parametrizations,for,Learning,From,High-Resolution,Signals,on,Meshes"

PlaneRCNN then refines an arbitrary number of segmentation masks with a novel loss enforcing the consistency with a nearby view during training. The paper also presents a new benchmark with more fine-grained plane segmentations in the ground-truth, in which, PlaneRCNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with significant margins in the plane detection, segmentation, and reconstruction metrics.

19,Occupancy Networks: Learning 3D Reconstruction in Function Space,"With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based approaches for 3D reconstruction have gained popularity. However, unlike for images, in 3D there is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstruction approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a restricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a new representation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution without excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation can efficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of input. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single images, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids. We believe that occupancy networks will become a useful tool in a wide variety of learning-based 3D tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Occupancy,Networks:,Learning,3D,Reconstruction,in,Function,Space"
20,3D Shape Reconstruction From Images in the Frequency Domain,"Reconstructing the high-resolution volumetric 3D shape from images is challenging due to the cubic growth of computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fourier-based method that reconstructs a 3D shape from images in a 2D space by predicting slices in the frequency domain. According to the Fourier slice projection theorem, we introduce a thickness map to bridge the domain gap between images in the spatial domain and slices in the frequency domain. The thickness map is the 2D spatial projection of the 3D shape, which is easily predicted from the input image by a general convolutional neural network. Each slice in the frequency domain is the Fourier transform of the corresponding thickness map. All slices constitute a 3D descriptor and the 3D shape is the inverse Fourier transform of the descriptor. Using slices in the frequency domain, our method can transfer the 3D shape reconstruction from the 3D space into the 2D space, which significantly reduces the computational cost. The experiment results on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"3D,Shape,Reconstruction,From,Images,in,the,Frequency,Domain"
21,SiCloPe: Silhouette-Based Clothed People,"We introduce a new silhouette-based representation for modeling clothed human bodies using deep generative models. Our method can reconstruct a complete and textured 3D model of a person wearing clothes from a single input picture. Inspired by the visual hull algorithm, our implicit representation uses 2D silhouettes and 3D joints of a body pose to describe the immense shape complexity and variations of clothed people. Given a segmented 2D silhouette of a person and its inferred 3D joints from the input picture, we first synthesize consistent silhouettes from novel view points around the subject. The synthesized silhouettes which are the most consistent with the input segmentation are fed into a deep visual hull algorithm for robust 3D shape prediction. We then infer the texture of the subject's back view using the frontal image and segmentation mask as input to a conditional generative adversarial network. Our experiments demonstrate that our silhouette-based model is an effective representation and the appearance of the back view can be predicted reliably using an image-to-image translation network. While classic methods based on parametric models often fail for single-view images of subjects with challenging clothing, our approach can still produce successful results, which are comparable to those obtained from multi-view input.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SiCloPe:,Silhouette-Based,Clothed,People"

It is a challenging task due to factors such as variations in human shapes, body poses, and viewpoints.  Prior methods typically attempt to recover the human body shape using a parametric based template that lacks the surface details.  As such the resulting body shape appears to be without clothing.  In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based framework that combines the robustness of parametric model with the flexibility of free-form 3D deformation.  We use the deep neural networks to refine the 3D shape in a Hierarchical Mesh Deformation (HMD) framework, utilizing the constraints from body joints, silhouettes, and per-pixel shading information.  We are able to restore detailed human body shapes beyond skinned models.  Experiments demonstrate that our method has outperformed previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving better accuracy in terms of both 2D IoU number and 3D metric distance.

23,Convolutional Mesh Regression for Single-Image Human Shape Reconstruction,"This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose and shape estimation from a single image. Previous approaches consider a parametric model of the human body, SMPL, and attempt to regress the model parameters that give rise to a mesh consistent with image evidence. This parameter regression has been a very challenging task, with model-based approaches underperforming compared to nonparametric solutions in terms of pose estimation. In our work, we propose to relax this heavy reliance on the model's parameter space. We still retain the topology of the SMPL template mesh, but instead of predicting model parameters, we directly regress the 3D location of the mesh vertices. This is a heavy task for a typical network, but our key insight is that the regression becomes significantly easier using a Graph-CNN. This architecture allows us to explicitly encode the template mesh structure within the network and leverage the spatial locality the mesh has to offer. Image-based features are attached to the mesh vertices and the Graph-CNN is responsible to process them on the mesh structure, while the regression target for each vertex is its 3D location. Having recovered the complete 3D geometry of the mesh, if we still require a specific model parametrization, this can be reliably regressed from the vertices locations. We demonstrate the flexibility and the effectiveness of our proposed graph-based mesh regression by attaching different types of features on the mesh vertices. In all cases, we outperform the comparable baselines relying on model parameter regression, while we also achieve state-of-the-art results among model-based pose estimation approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Convolutional,Mesh,Regression,for,Single-Image,Human,Shape,Reconstruction"

Given a single RGB image, our model jointly estimates the 3D hand and object poses, models their interactions, and recognizes the object and action classes with a single feed-forward pass through a neural network. We propose a single architecture that does not rely on external detection algorithms but rather is trained end-to-end on single images. We further merge and propagate information in the temporal domain to infer interactions between hand and object trajectories and recognize actions. The complete model takes as input a sequence of frames and outputs per-frame 3D hand and object pose predictions along with the estimates of object and action categories for the entire sequence.

Existing methods for recovering depth for dynamic, non-rigid objects from monocular video impose strong assumptions on the objects' motion and may only recover sparse depth. In this paper, we take a data-driven approach and learn human depth priors from a new source of data: thousands of Internet videos of people imitating mannequins, i.e., freezing in diverse, natural poses, while a hand-held camera tours the scene. Since the people are stationary, training data can be created from these videos using multi-view stereo reconstruction. At inference time, our method uses motion parallax cues from the static areas of the scenes, and shows clear improvement over state-of-the-art monocular depth prediction methods. We demonstrate our method on real-world sequences of complex human actions captured by a moving hand-held camera, and show various 3D effects produced using our predicted depth.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,the,Depths,of,Moving,People,by,Watching,Frozen,People"
26,Extreme Relative Pose Estimation for RGB-D Scans via Scene Completion,"Estimating the relative rigid pose between two RGB-D scans of the same underlying environment is a fundamental problem in computer vision, robotics, and computer graphics. Most existing approaches allow only limited maximum relative pose changes since they require considerable overlap between the input scans. We introduce a novel approach that extends the scope to extreme relative poses, with little or even no overlap between the input scans. The key idea is to infer more complete scene information about the underlying environment and match on the completed scans. In particular, instead of only performing scene completion from each individual scan, our approach alternates between relative pose estimation and scene completion. This allows us to perform scene completion by utilizing information from both input scans at late iterations, resulting in better results for both scene completion and relative pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach leads to considerable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for relative pose estimation. In particular, our approach provides encouraging relative pose estimates even between non-overlapping scans.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Extreme,Relative,Pose,Estimation,for,RGB-D,Scans,via,Scene,Completion"
27,A Skeleton-Bridged Deep Learning Approach for Generating Meshes of Complex Topologies From Single RGB Images,"This paper focuses on the challenging task of learning 3D object surface reconstructions from single RGB images. Existing methods achieve varying degrees of success by using different geometric representations. However, they all have their own drawbacks, and cannot well reconstruct those surfaces of complex topologies. To this end, we propose in this paper a skeleton-bridged, stage-wise learning approach to address the challenge. Our use of skeleton is due to its nice property of topology preservation, while being of lower complexity to learn. To learn skeleton from an input image, we design a deep architecture whose decoder is based on a novel design of parallel streams respectively for synthesis of curve- and surface-like skeleton points. We use different shape representations of point cloud, volume, and mesh in our stage-wise learning, in order to take their respective advantages. We also propose multi-stage use of the input image to correct prediction errors that are possibly accumulated in each stage.

28,Learning Structure-And-Motion-Aware Rolling Shutter Correction,"An exact method of correcting the rolling shutter (RS) effect requires recovering the underlying geometry, i.e. the scene structures and the camera motions between scanlines or between views. However, the multiple-view geometry for RS cameras is much more complicated than its global shutter (GS) counterpart, with various degeneracies. In this paper, we first make a theoretical contribution by showing that RS two-view geometry is degenerate in the case of pure translational camera motion. In view of the complex RS geometry, we then propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method which learns the underlying geometry (camera motion and scene structure) from just a single RS image and perform RS image correction. We call our method structure-and-motion-aware RS correction because it reasons about the concealed motions between the scanlines as well as the scene structure. Our method learns from a large-scale dataset synthesized in a geometrically meaningful way where the RS effect is generated in a manner consistent with the camera motion and scene structure. In extensive experiments, our method achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods for single image RS correction and subsequent Structure from Motion (SfM) applications.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Structure-And-Motion-Aware,Rolling,Shutter,Correction"
29,PVNet: Pixel-Wise Voting Network for 6DoF Pose Estimation,"This paper addresses the challenge of 6DoF pose estimation from a single RGB image under severe occlusion or truncation. Many recent works have shown that a two-stage approach, which first detects keypoints and then solves a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose estimation, achieves remarkable performance. However, most of these methods only localize a set of sparse keypoints by regressing their image coordinates or heatmaps, which are sensitive to occlusion and truncation. Instead, we introduce a Pixel-wise Voting Network (PVNet) to regress pixel-wise vectors pointing to the keypoints and use these vectors to vote for keypoint locations. This creates a flexible representation for localizing occluded or truncated keypoints. Another important feature of this representation is that it provides uncertainties of keypoint locations that can be further leveraged by the PnP solver. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art on the LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets by a large margin, while being efficient for real-time pose estimation. We further create a Truncation LINEMOD dataset to validate the robustness of our approach against truncation.

Our method distills reliable flow estimations from non-occluded pixels, and uses these predictions as ground truth to learn optical flow for hallucinated occlusions. We further design a simple CNN to utilize temporal information from multiple frames for better flow estimation. These two principles lead to an approach that yields the best performance for unsupervised optical flow learning on the challenging benchmarks including MPI Sintel, KITTI 2012 and  2015. More notably, our self-supervised pre-trained model provides an excellent initialization for supervised fine-tuning. Our fine-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art results on  all three datasets.

We first discuss the assumptions made by this well-established technique, and subsequently propose to relax these assumptions by incorporating data-driven priors into this model. More specifically, we unroll a robust version of the inverse compositional algorithm and replace multiple components of this algorithm using more expressive models whose parameters we train in an end-to-end fashion from data. Our experiments on several challenging 3D rigid motion estimation tasks demonstrate the advantages of combining optimization with learning-based techniques, outperforming the classic inverse compositional algorithm as well as data-driven image-to-pose regression approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Taking,a,Deeper,Look,at,the,Inverse,Compositional,Algorithm"
32,Deeper and Wider Siamese Networks for Real-Time Visual Tracking,"Siamese networks have drawn great attention in visual tracking because of their balanced accuracy and speed. However, the backbone networks used in Siamese trackers are relatively shallow, such as AlexNet, which does not fully take advantage of the capability of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage deeper and wider convolutional neural networks to enhance tracking robustness and accuracy. We observe that direct replacement of backbones with existing powerful architectures, such as ResNet and Inception, does not bring improvements. The main reasons are that 1) large increases in the receptive field of neurons lead to reduced feature discriminability and localization precision; and 2) the network padding for convolutions induces a positional bias in learning. To address these issues, we propose new residual modules to eliminate the negative impact of padding, and further design new architectures using these modules with controlled receptive field size and network stride. The designed architectures are lightweight and guarantee real-time tracking speed when applied to SiamFC and SiamRPN. Experiments show that solely due to the proposed network architectures, our SiamFC+ and SiamRPN+ obtain up to 9.8%/6.3% (AUC), 23.3%/8.8% (EAO) and 24.4%/25.0% (EAO) relative improvements over the original versions on the OTB-15, VOT-16 and VOT-17 datasets, respectively.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deeper,and,Wider,Siamese,Networks,for,Real-Time,Visual,Tracking"
33,Self-Supervised Adaptation of High-Fidelity Face Models for Monocular Performance Tracking,"Improvements in data-capture and face modeling techniques have enabled us to create high-fidelity realistic face models. However, driving these realistic face models requires special input data, e.g., 3D meshes and unwrapped textures. Also, these face models expect clean input data taken under controlled lab environments, which is very different from data collected in the wild. All these constraints make it challenging to use the high-fidelity models in tracking for commodity cameras. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised domain adaptation approach to enable the animation of high-fidelity face models from a commodity camera. Our approach first circumvents the requirement for special input data by training a new network that can directly drive a face model just from a single 2D image. Then, we overcome the domain mismatch between lab and uncontrolled environments by performing self-supervised domain adaptation based on ""consecutive frame texture consistency"" based on the assumption that the appearance of the face is consistent over consecutive frames, avoiding the necessity of modeling the new environment such as lighting or background. Experiments show that we are able to drive a high-fidelity face model to perform complex facial motion from a cellphone camera without requiring any labeled data from the new domain.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Supervised,Adaptation,of,High-Fidelity,Face,Models,for,Monocular,Performance,Tracking"

Our model leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and variational recurrent neural networks (VRNNs) to achieve a permutation equivariant model suitable for sports. On two challenging datasets (basketball and soccer), we show that we are able to produce more accurate forecasts than previous methods. We assess accuracy using various metrics, such as log-likelihood and ""best of N"" loss, based on N different samples of the future. We also measure the distribution of statistics of interest, such as player location or velocity, and show that the distribution induced by our generative model better matches the empirical distribution of the test set. Finally, we show that our model can perform conditional prediction, which lets us answer counterfactual questions such as ""how will the players move differently if A passes the ball to B instead of C?""",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Diverse,Generation,for,Multi-Agent,Sports,Games"

In particular, we propose a novel temporal topology cross-linked across limbs which can consistently handle  body motions of a wide range of magnitudes. Additionally, we make the overall approach recurrent in nature, where the network ingests STAF heatmaps from previous frames and estimates those for the current frame. Our approach uses only online inference and tracking, and is currently the fastest and the most accurate bottom-up approach that is runtime-invariant to the number of people in the scene and accuracy-invariant to input frame rate of camera. Running at ~30 fps on a single GPU at single scale, it achieves highly competitive results on the PoseTrack benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Efficient,Online,Multi-Person,2D,Pose,Tracking,With,Recurrent,Spatio-Temporal,Affinity,Fields"

GFrames are based on the computation of the intrinsic gradient of a scalar field defined on top of the input shape. The resulting tangent vector field defines a repeatable tangent direction of the local frame at each point; importantly, it directly inherits the properties and invariance classes of the underlying scalar function, making it remarkably robust under strong sampling artifacts, vertex noise, as well as non-rigid deformations. Existing local descriptors can directly benefit from our repeatable frames, as we showcase in a selection of 3D vision and shape analysis applications where we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of challenging settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"GFrames:,Gradient-Based,Local,Reference,Frame,for,3D,Shape,Matching"

Many state-of-the-art approaches now  use sequence  models  to solve  this  problem but  their  training can  be affected by biases that decrease their  efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new training procedure that confronts the algorithm to its own mistakes while explicitly  attempting to  minimize the  number of  switches, which  results in better training.  We propose an iterative scheme of building  a rich training set and using it to learn a  scoring function  that is  an explicit proxy  for the  target tracking metric.  Whether using  only simple  geometric features  or more  sophisticated ones  that also  take appearance  into  account, our  approach outperforms  the state-of-the-art on several MOT benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Eliminating,Exposure,Bias,and,Metric,Mismatch,in,Multiple,Object,Tracking"
38,Graph Convolutional Tracking,"Tracking by siamese networks has achieved favorable performance in recent years. However, most of existing siamese methods do not take full advantage of spatial-temporal target appearance modeling under different contextual situations. In fact, the spatial-temporal information can provide diverse features to enhance the target representation, and the context information is important for online adaption of target localization. To comprehensively leverage the spatial-temporal structure of historical target exemplars and get benefit from the context information, in this work, we present a novel Graph Convolutional Tracking (GCT) method for high-performance visual tracking. Specifically, the GCT jointly incorporates two types of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) into a siamese framework for target appearance modeling. Here, we adopt a spatial-temporal GCN to model the structured representation of historical target exemplars. Furthermore, a context GCN is designed to utilize the context of the current frame to learn adaptive features for target localization. Extensive results on 4 challenging benchmarks show that our GCT method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers while running around 50 frames per second.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Graph,Convolutional,Tracking"
39,ATOM: Accurate Tracking by Overlap Maximization,"While recent years have witnessed astonishing improvements in visual tracking robustness, the advancements in tracking accuracy have been limited. As the focus has been directed towards the development of powerful classifiers, the problem of accurate target state estimation has been largely overlooked. In fact, most trackers resort to a simple multi-scale search in order to estimate the target bounding box. We argue that this approach is fundamentally limited since target estimation is a complex task, requiring high-level knowledge about the object.  We address this problem by proposing a novel tracking architecture, consisting of dedicated target estimation and classification components. High level knowledge is incorporated into the target estimation through extensive offline learning. Our target estimation component is trained to predict the overlap between the target object and an estimated bounding box. By carefully integrating target-specific information, our approach achieves previously unseen bounding box accuracy. We further introduce a classification component that is trained online to guarantee high discriminative power in the presence of distractors. Our final tracking framework sets a new state-of-the-art on five challenging benchmarks. On the new large-scale TrackingNet dataset, our tracker ATOM achieves a relative gain of 15% over the previous best approach, while running at over 30 FPS.

First, this adaptive spatial regularization scheme could learn an effective spatial weight for a specific object and its appearance variations, and therefore result in more reliable filter coefficients during the tracking process. Second, our ASRCF model can be effectively optimized based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, where each subproblem has the closed-from solution. Third, our tracker applies two kinds of CF models to estimate the location and scale respectively. The location CF model exploits ensembles of shallow and deep features to determine the optimal position accurately. The scale CF model works on multi-scale shallow features to estimate the optimal scale efficiently. Extensive experiments on five recent benchmarks show that our tracker performs favorably against many state-of-the-art algorithms, with real-time performance of 28fps.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Visual,Tracking,via,Adaptive,Spatially-Regularized,Correlation,Filters"
41,Deep Tree Learning for Zero-Shot Face Anti-Spoofing,"Face anti-spoofing is designed to keep face recognition systems from recognizing fake faces as the genuine users. While advanced face anti-spoofing methods are developed, new types of spoof attacks are also being created and becoming a threat to all existing systems. We define the detection of unknown spoof attacks as Zero-Shot Face Anti-spoofing (ZSFA). Previous works of ZSFA only study 1-2 types of spoof attacks, such as print/replay attacks, which limits the insight of this problem. In this work, we expand the ZSFA problem to a wide range of 13 types of spoof attacks, including print attack, replay attack, 3D mask attacks, and so on. A novel Deep Tree Network (DTN) is proposed to tackle the ZSFA. The tree is learned to partition the spoof samples into semantic sub-groups in an unsupervised fashion. When a data sample arrives, being know or unknown attacks, DTN routes it to the most similar spoof cluster, and make the binary decision. In addition, to enable the study of ZSFA, we introduce the first face anti-spoofing database that contains diverse types of spoof attacks.

42,ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition,"One of the main challenges in feature learning using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for large-scale face recognition is the design of appropriate loss functions that can enhance the discriminative power. Centre loss penalises the distance between deep features and their corresponding class centres in the Euclidean space to achieve intra-class compactness. SphereFace assumes that the linear transformation matrix in the last fully connected layer can be used as a representation of the class centres in the angular space and therefore penalises the angles between deep features and their corresponding weights in a multiplicative way. Recently, a popular line of research is to incorporate margins in well-established loss functions in order to maximise face class separability. In this paper, we propose an Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. The proposed ArcFace has a clear geometric interpretation due to its exact correspondence to geodesic distance on a hypersphere. We present arguably the most extensive experimental evaluation against all recent state-of-the-art face recognition methods on ten face recognition benchmarks which includes a new large-scale image database with trillions of pairs and a large-scale video dataset. We show that ArcFace consistently outperforms the state of the art and can be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead.

43,Learning Joint Gait Representation via Quintuplet Loss Minimization,"Gait recognition is an important biometric method popularly used in video surveillance, where the task is to identify people at a distance by their walking patterns from video sequences. Most of the current successful approaches for gait recognition either use a pair of gait images to form a cross-gait representation or rely on a single gait image for unique-gait representation. These two types of representations emperically complement one another. In this paper, we propose a new Joint Unique-gait and Cross-gait Network (JUCNet), to combine the advantages of unique-gait representation with that of cross-gait representation, leading to an significantly improved performance. Another key contribution of this paper is a novel quintuplet loss function, which simultaneously increases the inter-class differences by pushing representations extracted from different subjects apart and decreases the intra-class variations by pulling representations extracted from the same subject together. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance tested on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Joint,Gait,Representation,via,Quintuplet,Loss,Minimization"

Most of the existing gait recognition methods take silhouettes or articulated body models as the gait features. These methods suffer from degraded recognition performance when handling confounding variables, such as clothing, carrying and view angle. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel AutoEncoder framework to explicitly disentangle pose and appearance features from RGB imagery and the LSTM-based integration of pose features over time produces the gait feature. In addition, we collect a Frontal-View Gait (FVG) dataset to focus on gait recognition from frontal-view walking, which is a challenging problem since it contains minimal gait cues compared to other views. FVG also includes other important variations,e.g., walking speed, carrying, and clothing. With extensive experiments on CASIA-B, USF and FVG datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance to the-state-of-the-arts quantitatively, the ability of feature disentanglement qualitatively, and promising computational efficiency.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Gait,Recognition,via,Disentangled,Representation,Learning"

These architectures are approximately invertible by design and thus partially satisfy cycle-consistency before training even begins.

In this paper, we propose a novel and practical methodology to verify the integrity of remote deep learning models, with only black-box access to the target models. Specifically, we define Sensitive-Sample fingerprints, which are a small set of human unnoticeable transformed inputs that make the model outputs sensitive to the model's parameters. Even small model changes can be clearly reflected in the model outputs. Experimental results on different types of model integrity attacks show that we proposed approach is both effective and efficient. It can detect model integrity breaches with high accuracy (>99.95%) and guaranteed zero false positives on all evaluated attacks.

It is crucial to classify each class correctly while learning adequate interclass ordinal relationships. We present a simple and effective method that constrains these relationships among categories by seamlessly incorporating metric penalties into ground truth label representations. This encoding allows deep neural networks to automatically learn intraclass and interclass relationships without any explicit modification of the network architecture. Our method converts data labels into soft probability distributions that pair well with common categorical loss functions such as cross-entropy. We show that this approach is effective by using off-the-shelf classification and segmentation networks in four wildly different scenarios: image quality ranking, age estimation, horizon line regression, and monocular depth estimation. We demonstrate that our general-purpose method is very competitive with respect to specialized approaches, and adapts well to a variety of different network architectures and metrics.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Soft,Labels,for,Ordinal,Regression"

LGL is most related to the Self-Paced Learning (SPL) algorithm but its formulation is different from SPL. SPL trains its data from simple to complex, while LGL from local to global. In this paper, we incorporate the idea of LGL into the learning objective of DNNs and explain why LGL works better from an information-theoretic perspective.

But, the fact that we do not know when a specific DNN will work and when it will fail has resulted in a lack of trust. A clear example is self-driving cars; people are uncomfortable sitting in a car driven by algorithms that may fail under some unknown, unpredictable conditions. Interpretability and explainability approaches attempt to address this by uncovering what a DNN models, i.e., what each node (cell) in the network represents and what images are most likely to activate it. This can be used to generate, for example, adversarial attacks. But these approaches do not generally allow us to determine where a DNN will succeed or fail and   why . i.e., does this learned representation   generalize  to unseen samples?

The design of deep neural network models makes it necessary to extend training datasets in order to introduce variations and increase the number of samples; word-retrieval is therefore very difficult in low-resource scripts. Much of the existing literature comprises preprocessing strategies which are seldom sufficient to cover all possible variations. We propose an Adversarial Feature Deformation Module (AFDM) that learns ways to elastically warp extracted features in a scalable manner. The AFDM is inserted between intermediate layers and trained alternatively with the original framework, boosting its capability to better learn highly informative features rather than trivial ones. We test our meta-framework, which is built on top of popular word-spotting and word-recognition frameworks and enhanced by AFDM, not only on extensive Latin word datasets but also on sparser Indic scripts.

This work proposes a profiling-based method to decompose the DNN models to different functional blocks, which lead to the effective path as a new approach to exploring DNNs' internal organization. Specifically, the per-image effective path can be aggregated to the class-level effective path, through which we observe that adversarial images activate effective path different from normal images.

Our method integrates reinforced mutation into an evolution algorithm for neural architecture exploration, in which a mutation controller is introduced to learn the effects of slight modifications and make mutation actions. The reinforced mutation controller guides the model population to evolve efficiently. Furthermore, as child models can inherit parameters from their parents during evolution, our method requires very limited computational resources. In experiments, we conduct the proposed search method on CIFAR-10 and obtain a powerful network architecture, RENASNet. This architecture achieves a competitive result on CIFAR-10. The explored network architecture is transferable to ImageNet and achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy, i.e., 75.7% top-1 accuracy with 5.36M parameters on mobile ImageNet.

53,Co-Occurrence Neural Network,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) became a very popular tool for image analysis. Convolutions are fast to compute and easy to store, but they also have some limitations. First, they are shift-invariant and, as a result, they do not adapt to different regions of the image. Second, they have a fixed spatial layout, so small geometric deformations in the layout of a patch will completely change the filter response. For these reasons, we need multiple filters to handle the different parts and variations in the input. We augment the standard convolutional tools used in CNNs with a new filter that addresses both issues raised above. Our filter combines two terms, a spatial filter and a term that is based on the co-occurrence statistics of input values in the neighborhood. The proposed filter is differentiable and can therefore be packaged as a layer in CNN and trained using back-propagation. We show how to train the filter as part of the network and report results on several data sets. In particular, we replace a convolutional layer with hundreds of thousands of parameters with a Co-occurrence Layer consisting of only a few hundred parameters with minimal impact on accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Co-Occurrence,Neural,Network"

In this paper, we propose an adaptive fine-tuning approach, called SpotTune, which finds the optimal fine-tuning strategy per instance for the target data. In SpotTune, given an image from the target task, a policy network is used to make routing decisions on whether to pass the image through the fine-tuned layers or the pre-trained layers. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method outperforms the traditional fine-tuning approach on 12 out of 14 standard datasets. We also compare SpotTune with other state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, showing superior performance.

55,Signal-To-Noise Ratio: A Robust Distance Metric for Deep Metric Learning,"Deep metric learning, which learns discriminative features to process image clustering and retrieval tasks, has attracted extensive attention in recent years. A number of deep metric learning methods, which ensure that similar examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped farther apart, have been proposed to construct effective structures for loss functions and have shown promising results. In this paper, different from the approaches on learning the loss structures, we propose a robust SNR distance metric based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for measuring the similarity of image pairs for deep metric learning. By exploring the properties of our SNR distance metric from the view of geometry space and statistical theory, we analyze the properties of our metric and show that it can preserve the semantic similarity between image pairs, which well justify its suitability for deep metric learning. Compared with Euclidean distance metric, our SNR distance metric can further jointly reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the inter-class distances for learned features. Leveraging our SNR distance metric, we propose Deep SNR-based Metric Learning (DSML) to generate discriminative feature embeddings. By extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks, including CARS196, CUB200-2011 and CIFAR10, our DSML has shown its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.

56,Detection Based Defense Against Adversarial Examples From the Steganalysis Point of View,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently led to significant improvements in many fields. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are samples with imperceptible perturbations while dramatically misleading the DNNs. Moreover, adversarial examples can be used to perform an attack on various kinds of DNN based systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Many defense methods have been proposed, such as obfuscating gradients of the networks or detecting adversarial examples. However it is proved out that these defense methods are not effective or cannot resist secondary adversarial attacks. In this paper, we point out that steganalysis can be applied to adversarial examples detection, and propose a method to enhance steganalysis features by estimating the probability of modifications caused by adversarial attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect adversarial examples. Moreover, secondary adversarial attacks are hard to be directly performed to our method because our method is not based on a neural network but based on high-dimensional artificial features and Fisher Linear Discriminant ensemble.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Detection,Based,Defense,Against,Adversarial,Examples,From,the,Steganalysis,Point,of,View"
57,HetConv: Heterogeneous Kernel-Based Convolutions for Deep CNNs,"We present a novel deep learning architecture in which the convolution operation leverages heterogeneous kernels. The proposed HetConv (Heterogeneous Kernel-Based Convolution) reduces the computation (FLOPs) and the number of parameters as compared to standard convolution operation while still maintaining representational efficiency. To show the effectiveness of our proposed convolution, we present extensive experimental results on the standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as VGG  and ResNet. We find that after replacing the standard convolutional filters in these architectures with our proposed HetConv filters, we achieve 3X to 8X FLOPs based improvement in speed while still maintaining (and sometimes improving) the accuracy. We also compare our proposed convolutions with group/depth wise convolutions and show that it achieves more FLOPs reduction with significantly higher accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"HetConv:,Heterogeneous,Kernel-Based,Convolutions,for,Deep,CNNs"
58,Strike (With) a Pose: Neural Networks Are Easily Fooled by Strange Poses of Familiar Objects,"Despite excellent performance on stationary test sets, deep neural networks (DNNs) can fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs, including natural, non-adversarial ones, which are common in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a framework for discovering DNN failures that harnesses 3D renderers and 3D models. That is, we estimate the parameters of a 3D renderer that cause a target DNN to misbehave in response to the rendered image. Using our framework and a self-assembled dataset of 3D objects, we investigate the vulnerability of DNNs to OoD poses of well-known objects in ImageNet. For objects that are readily recognized by DNNs in their canonical poses, DNNs incorrectly classify 97% of their pose space. In addition, DNNs are highly sensitive to slight pose perturbations. Importantly, adversarial poses transfer across models and datasets. We find that 99.9% and 99.4% of the poses misclassified by Inception-v3 also transfer to the AlexNet and ResNet-50 image classifiers trained on the same ImageNet dataset, respectively, and 75.5% transfer to the YOLOv3 object detector trained on MS COCO.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Strike,(With),a,Pose:,Neural,Networks,Are,Easily,Fooled,by,Strange,Poses,of,Familiar,Objects"

Our proposed method employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by using a large synthetic distortion dataset to predict the displacement field between distorted images and corrected images. A model fitting method uses the CNN output to estimate the distortion parameters, achieving a more accurate prediction. The final corrected image is generated based on the predicted flow using an efficient, high-quality resampling method. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional correction methods, and allows for interesting applications such as distortion transfer, distortion exaggeration, and co-occurring distortion correction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Blind,Geometric,Distortion,Correction,on,Images,Through,Deep,Learning"

ILM Norm learns to predict the normalization parameters via both the feature feed-forward and the gradient back-propagation paths. ILM Norm provides a meta normalization mechanism and has several good properties. It can be easily plugged into existing instance-level normalization schemes such as Instance Normalization, Layer Normalization, or Group Normalization. ILM Norm normalizes each instance individually and therefore maintains high performance even when small mini-batch is used. The experimental results show that ILM Norm well adapts to different network architectures and tasks, and it consistently improves the performance of the original models.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Instance-Level,Meta,Normalization"
61,Iterative Normalization: Beyond Standardization Towards Efficient Whitening,"Batch Normalization (BN) is ubiquitously employed for accelerating neural network training and improving the generalization capability by performing standardization within mini-batches.  Decorrelated Batch Normalization (DBN) further boosts the above effectiveness by whitening.  However, DBN relies heavily on either a large batch size, or eigen-decomposition that suffers from poor efficiency on GPUs.  We propose Iterative Normalization (IterNorm), which employs Newton's iterations for much more efficient whitening, while simultaneously avoiding the eigen-decomposition. Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive study to show IterNorm has better trade-off between optimization and generalization, with theoretical and experimental support. To this end, we exclusively introduce Stochastic Normalization Disturbance (SND), which measures the inherent stochastic uncertainty of samples when applied to normalization operations. With the support of SND, we provide natural explanations to several phenomena from the perspective of optimization, e.g., why group-wise whitening of DBN generally outperforms full-whitening and why the accuracy of BN degenerates with reduced batch sizes.  We demonstrate the consistently improved performance of IterNorm with extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over BN and DBN.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Iterative,Normalization:,Beyond,Standardization,Towards,Efficient,Whitening"
62,On Learning Density Aware Embeddings,"Deep metric learning algorithms have been utilized to learn discriminative and generalizable models which are effective for classifying unseen classes. In this paper, a novel noise tolerant deep metric learning algorithm is proposed. The proposed method, termed as Density Aware Metric Learning, enforces the model to learn embeddings that are pulled towards the most dense region of the clusters for each class. It is achieved by iteratively shifting the estimate of the center towards the dense region of the cluster thereby leading to faster convergence and higher generalizability. In addition to this, the approach is robust to noisy samples in the training data, often present as outliers. Detailed experiments and analysis on two challenging cross-modal face recognition databases and two popular object recognition databases exhibit the efficacy of the proposed approach. It has superior convergence, requires lesser training time, and yields better accuracies than several popular deep metric learning methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"On,Learning,Density,Aware,Embeddings"

To address this issue, this paper proposes Contrastive Adaptation Network (CAN) optimizing a new metric which explicitly models the intra-class domain discrepancy and the inter-class domain discrepancy. We design an alternating update strategy for training CAN in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two real-world benchmarks Office-31 and VisDA-2017 demonstrate that CAN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods and produces more discriminative features.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Contrastive,Adaptation,Network,for,Unsupervised,Domain,Adaptation"
64,LP-3DCNN: Unveiling Local Phase in 3D Convolutional Neural Networks,"Traditional 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are computationally expensive, memory intensive, prone to overfit, and most importantly, there is a need to improve their feature learning capabilities. To address these issues, we propose Rectified Local Phase Volume (ReLPV) block, an efficient alternative to the standard 3D convolutional layer. The ReLPV block extracts the phase in a 3D local neighborhood (e.g., 3x3x3) of each position of the input map to obtain the feature maps. The phase is extracted by computing 3D Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT) at multiple fixed low frequency points in the 3D local neighborhood of each position. These feature maps at different frequency points are then linearly combined after passing them through an activation function.  The ReLPV block provides significant parameter savings of at least, 3^3 to 13^3 times compared to the standard 3D convolutional layer with the filter sizes 3x3x3 to 13x13x13, respectively. We show that the  feature learning capabilities of the ReLPV block are significantly better than the standard 3D convolutional layer. Furthermore, it produces consistently better results across different 3D data representations. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the volumetric ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 datasets while utilizing only 11% parameters of the current state-of-the-art. We also improve the state-of-the-art on the  UCF-101 split-1 action recognition dataset by 5.68% (when trained from scratch) while using only 15% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LP-3DCNN:,Unveiling,Local,Phase,in,3D,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"
65,Attribute-Driven Feature Disentangling and Temporal Aggregation for Video Person Re-Identification,"Video-based person re-identification plays an important role in surveillance video analysis, expanding image-based methods by learning features of multiple frames. Most existing methods fuse features by temporal average-pooling, without exploring the different frame weights caused by various viewpoints, poses, and occlusions. In this paper, we propose an attribute-driven method for feature disentangling and frame re-weighting. The features of single frames are disentangled into groups of sub-features, each corresponds to specific semantic attributes. The sub-features are re-weighted by the confidence of attribute recognition and then aggregated at the temporal dimension as the final representation. By means of this strategy, the most informative regions of each frame are enhanced and contributes to a more discriminative sequence representation. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of feature disentangling as well as temporal re-weighting. The experimental results on the iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and MARS datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attribute-Driven,Feature,Disentangling,and,Temporal,Aggregation,for,Video,Person,Re-Identification"
66,Binary Ensemble Neural Network: More Bits per Network or More Networks per Bit?,"Binary neural networks (BNN) have been studied extensively since they run dramatically faster at lower memory and power consumption than floating-point networks, thanks to the efficiency of bit operations. However, contemporary BNNs whose weights and activations are both single bits suffer from severe accuracy degradation. To understand why, we investigate the representation ability, speed and bias/variance of BNNs through extensive experiments. We conclude that the error of BNNs is predominantly caused by intrinsic instability (training time) and non-robustness (train & test time). Inspired by this investigation, we propose the Binary Ensemble Neural Network (BENN) which leverages ensemble methods to improve the performance of BNNs with limited efficiency cost. While ensemble techniques have been broadly believed to be only marginally helpful for strong classifiers such as deep neural networks, our analysis and experiments show that they are naturally a perfect fit to boost BNNs. We find that our BENN, which is faster and more robust than state-of-the-art binary networks, can even surpass the accuracy of the full-precision floating number network with the same architecture.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Binary,Ensemble,Neural,Network:,More,Bits,per,Network,or,More,Networks,per,Bit?"
67,Distilling Object Detectors With Fine-Grained Feature Imitation,"State-of-the-art CNN based recognition models are often computationally prohibitive to deploy on low-end devices. A promising high level approach tackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization. However, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do not consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla knowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain.  To address the challenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained feature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature response. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object regions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor locations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to generalize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let student model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first validate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries simplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on challenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the student model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively evaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common object detection benchmark of Pascal VOC and COCO, imitation alleviates up to 74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher.

68,Centripetal SGD for Pruning Very Deep Convolutional Networks With Complicated Structure,"The redundancy is widely recognized in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which enables to remove some unimportant filters from convolutional layers so as to slim the network with acceptable performance drop. Inspired by the linearity of convolution, we seek to make some filters increasingly close and eventually identical for network slimming. To this end, we propose Centripetal SGD (C-SGD), a novel optimization method, which can train several filters to collapse into a single point in the parameter hyperspace. When the training is completed, the removal of the identical filters can trim the network with NO performance loss, thus no finetuning is needed. By doing so, we have partly solved an open problem of constrained filter pruning on CNNs with complicated structure, where some layers must be pruned following the others. Our experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have justified the effectiveness of C-SGD-based filter pruning. Moreover, we have provided empirical evidences for the assumption that the redundancy in deep neural networks helps the convergence of training by showing that a redundant CNN trained using C-SGD outperforms a normally trained counterpart with the equivalent width.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Centripetal,SGD,for,Pruning,Very,Deep,Convolutional,Networks,With,Complicated,Structure"
69,Knockoff Nets: Stealing Functionality of Black-Box Models,"Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in the wild to perform a wide range of tasks. In this work, we ask to what extent can an adversary steal functionality of such ""victim"" models based solely on blackbox interactions: image in, predictions out. In contrast to prior work, we study complex victim blackbox models, and an adversary lacking knowledge of train/test data used by the model, its internals, and semantics over model outputs. We formulate model functionality stealing as a two-step approach: (i) querying a set of input images to the blackbox model to obtain predictions; and (ii) training a ""knockoff"" with queried image-prediction pairs. We make multiple remarkable observations: (a) querying random images from a different distribution than that of the blackbox training data results in a well-performing knockoff; (b) this is possible even when the knockoff is represented using a different architecture; and (c) our reinforcement learning approach additionally improves query sample efficiency in certain settings and provides performance gains. We validate model functionality stealing on a range of datasets and tasks, as well as show that a reasonable knockoff of an image analysis API could be created for as little as 30.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Knockoff,Nets:,Stealing,Functionality,of,Black-Box,Models"
70,Deep Embedding Learning With Discriminative Sampling Policy,"Deep embedding learning aims to learn a distance metric for effective similarity measurement, which has achieved promising performance in various tasks. As the vast majority of training samples produce gradients with magnitudes close to zero, hard example mining is usually employed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the training procedure. However, most existing sampling methods are designed by hand, which ignores the dependence between examples and suffer from exhaustive searching. In this paper, we propose a deep embedding with discriminative sampling policy (DE-DSP) learning framework by simultaneously training two models: a deep sampler network that learns effective sampling strategies, and a feature embedding that maps samples to the feature space. Rather than exhaustively calculating the hardness of all the examples for mining through forward-propagation, the deep sampler network exploits the strong prior of relations among samples to learn discriminative sampling policy in an more efficient manner. Experimental results demonstrate faster convergence and stronger discriminative power of our DE-DSP framework under different embedding objectives.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Embedding,Learning,With,Discriminative,Sampling,Policy"
71,Hybrid Task Cascade for Instance Segmentation,"Cascade is a classic yet powerful architecture that has boosted performance on various tasks. However, how to introduce cascade to instance segmentation remains an open question. A simple combination of Cascade R-CNN and Mask R-CNN only brings limited gain. In exploring a more effective approach, we find that the key to a successful instance segmentation cascade is to fully leverage the reciprocal relationship between detection and segmentation. In this work, we propose a new framework, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), which differs in two important aspects: (1) instead of performing cascaded refinement on these two tasks separately, it interweaves them for a joint multi-stage processing; (2) it adopts a fully convolutional branch to provide spatial context, which can help distinguishing hard foreground from cluttered background. Overall, this framework can learn more discriminative features progressively while integrating complementary features together in each stage. Without bells and whistles, a single HTC obtains 38.4% and 1.5% improvement over a strong Cascade Mask R-CNN baseline on MSCOCO dataset. Moreover, our overall system achieves 48.6 mask AP on the test-challenge split, ranking 1st in the COCO 2018 Challenge Object Detection Task.

To make better use of given limited labels, we propose a novel object detection approach that takes advantage of both multi-task learning (MTL) and self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a set of auxiliary tasks that help improve the accuracy of object detection. They create their own labels by recycling the bounding box labels (i.e. annotations of the main task) in an SSL manner, and are jointly trained with the object detection model in an MTL way. Our approach is integrable with any region proposal based detection models. We empirically validate that our approach effectively improves detection performance on various architectures and datasets. We test two state-of-the-art region proposal object detectors, including Faster R-CNN and R-FCN, with three CNN backbones of ResNet-101, Inception-ResNet-v2, and MobileNet on two benchmark datasets of PASCAL VOC and COCO.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Task,Self-Supervised,Object,Detection,via,Recycling,of,Bounding,Box,Annotations"

Existing works mostly rely on massive amounts of rotation-augmented data to alleviate the problem, which lacks solid guarantee of the 3D rotation invariance. In this paper, we address the issue by introducing a novel point cloud representation that can be mathematically proved rigorously rotation-invariant, i.e., identical point clouds in different orientations are unified as a unique and consistent representation. Moreover, the proposed representation is conditional information-lossless, because it retains all necessary information of point cloud except for orientation information. In addition, the proposed representation is complementary with existing network architectures for point cloud and fundamentally improves their robustness against rotation transformation. Finally, we propose a deep hierarchical cluster network called ClusterNet to better adapt to the proposed representation. We employ hierarchical clustering to explore and exploit the geometric structure of point cloud, which is embedded in a hierarchical structure tree.

However, learning to learn the relation between people in an image, and inferring the most important person based on this relation, remains undeveloped. In this work, we propose a deep imPOrtance relatIon NeTwork (POINT) that combines both relation modeling and feature learning. In particular, we infer two types of interaction modules: the person-person interaction module that learns the interaction between people and the event-person interaction module that learns to describe how a person is involved in the event occurring in an image. We then estimate the importance relations among people from both interactions and encode the relation feature from the importance relations. In this way, POINT automatically learns several types of relation features in parallel, and we aggregate these relation features and the person's feature to form the importance feature for important people classification. Extensive experimental results show that our method is effective for important people detection and verify the efficacy of learning to learn relations for important people detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Learn,Relation,for,Important,People,Detection,in,Still,Images"

Existing attention-based approaches localize and amplify significant parts to learn fine-grained details, which often suffer from a limited number of parts and heavy computational cost. In this paper, we propose to learn such fine-grained features from hundreds of part proposals by Trilinear Attention Sampling Network (TASN) in an efficient teacher-student manner. Specifically, TASN consists of 1) a trilinear attention module, which generates attention maps by modeling the inter-channel relationships, 2) an attention-based sampler which highlights attended parts with high resolution, and 3) a feature distiller, which distills part features into an object-level feature by weight sharing and feature preserving strategies. Extensive experiments verify that TASN yields the best performance under the same settings with the most competitive approaches, in iNaturalist-2017, CUB-Bird, and Stanford-Cars datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Looking,for,the,Devil,in,the,Details:,Learning,Trilinear,Attention,Sampling,Network,for,Fine-Grained,Image,Recognition"

In this pa-per, we provide a general weighting framework for under-standing  recent  pair-based  loss  functions.   Our  contributions are three-fold: (1) we establish a General Pair Weighting (GPW) framework, which casts the sampling problem of deep metric learning into a unified view of pair weighting through gradient analysis, providing a powerful tool for understanding recent pair-based loss functions; (2) we show that with GPW, various existing pair-based methods can be compared and discussed comprehensively, with clear differences and key limitations identified; (3) we propose a new loss called multi-similarity loss (MS loss) under the GPW,which is implemented in two iterative steps (i.e., mining and weighting). This allows it to fully consider three similarities for pair weighting, providing a more principled approach for collecting and weighting informative pairs. Finally, the proposed MS loss obtains new state-of-the-art performance on four image retrieval benchmarks, where it outperforms the  most  recent  approaches,  such  as  ABE[14]  and  HTL[4], by a large margin, e.g.,60.6%-65.7%on CUB200,and 80.9%-88.0%on In-Shop Clothes Retrieval datasetat Recall@1.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Similarity,Loss,With,General,Pair,Weighting,for,Deep,Metric,Learning"
77,Domain-Symmetric Networks for Adversarial Domain Adaptation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to learn a model of classifier for unlabeled samples on the target domain, given training data of labeled samples on the source domain. Impressive progress is made recently by learning invariant features via domain-adversarial training of deep networks. In spite of the recent progress, domain adaptation is still limited in achieving the invariance of feature distributions at a finer category level. To this end, we propose in this paper a new domain adaptation method called Domain-Symmetric Networks (SymNets). The proposed SymNet is  based on a symmetric design of source and target task classifiers, based on which we also construct an additional classifier that shares with them its layer neurons. To train the SymNet, we propose a novel adversarial learning objective whose key design is based on a two-level domain confusion scheme, where the category-level confusion loss improves over the domain-level one by driving the learning of intermediate network features to be invariant at the corresponding categories of the two domains. Both domain discrimination and domain confusion are implemented based on the constructed additional classifier. Since target samples are unlabeled, we also propose a scheme of cross-domain training to help learn the target classifier. Careful ablation studies show the efficacy of our proposed method. In particular, based on commonly used base networks, our SymNets achieve the new state of the art on three benchmark domain adaptation datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Domain-Symmetric,Networks,for,Adversarial,Domain,Adaptation"

In recent years, several works have achieved state of the art results on hashing benchmarks by learning binary representations in a supervised manner. This work presents Deep Product Quantization (DPQ), a technique that leads to more accurate retrieval and classification than the latest state of the art methods, while having similar computational complexity and memory footprint as the Product Quantization method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a dictionary-based representation that is inspired by Product Quantization and which is learned end-to-end, and thus benefits from the supervised signal. DPQ explicitly learns soft and hard representations to enable an efficient and accurate asymmetric search, by using a straight-through estimator.

There exist many inexpensive data sources on the web, but they tend to contain inaccurate labels. Training on noisy labeled datasets causes performance degradation because DNNs can easily overfit to the label noise. To overcome this problem, we propose a noise-tolerant training algorithm, where a meta-learning update is performed prior to conventional gradient update. The proposed meta-learning method simulates actual training by generating synthetic noisy labels, and train the model such that after one gradient update using each set of synthetic noisy labels, the model does not overfit to the specific noise. We conduct extensive experiments on the noisy CIFAR-10 dataset and the Clothing1M dataset.

Specially, progressive anchor loss (PAL) computed by using two set of anchors is adopted to effectively facilitate the features.

Classic methods on semi-supervised learning that have focused on transductive learning have not been fully exploited in the inductive framework followed by modern deep learning. The same holds for the manifold assumption---that similar examples should get the same prediction. In this work, we employ a transductive label propagation method that is based on the manifold assumption to make predictions on the entire dataset and use these predictions to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and train a deep neural network. At the core of the transductive method lies a nearest neighbor graph of the dataset that we create based on the embeddings of the same network. Therefore our learning process iterates between these two steps. We improve performance on several datasets especially in the few labels regime and show that our work is complementary to current state of the art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Label,Propagation,for,Deep,Semi-Supervised,Learning"
82,Deep Global Generalized Gaussian Networks,"Recently, global covariance pooling (GCP) has shown great advance in improving classification performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, existing deep GCP networks compute covariance pooling of convolutional activations with assumption that activations are sampled from Gaussian distributions, which may not hold in practice and fails to fully characterize the statistics of activations. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep global generalized Gaussian network (3G-Net), whose core is to estimate a global covariance of generalized Gaussian for modeling the last convolutional activations. Compared with GCP in Gaussian setting, our 3G-Net assumes the distribution of activations follows a generalized Gaussian, which can capture more precise characteristics of activations. However, there exists no analytic solution for parameter estimation of generalized Gaussian, making our 3G-Net challenging. To this end, we first present a novel regularized maximum likelihood estimator for robust estimating covariance of generalized Gaussian, which can be optimized by a modified iterative re-weighted method. Then, to efficiently estimate the covariance of generaized Gaussian under deep CNN architectures, we approximate this re-weighted method by developing an unrolling re-weighted module and a square root covariance layer. In this way, 3GNet can be flexibly trained in an end-to-end manner. The experiments are conducted on large-scale ImageNet-1K and Places365 datasets, and the results demonstrate our 3G-Net outperforms its counterparts while achieving very competitive performance to state-of-the-arts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Global,Generalized,Gaussian,Networks"

Existing works either require aligned sketch-image pairs or inefficient memory fusion layer for mapping the visual information to a semantic space. In this work, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent generative (SEM-PCYC) model for zero-shot SBIR, where each branch maps the visual information to a common semantic space via an adversarial training. Each of these branches maintains a cycle consistency that only requires supervision at category levels, and avoids the need of highly-priced aligned sketch-image pairs. A classification criteria on the generators' outputs ensures the visual to semantic space mapping to be discriminating. Furthermore, we propose to combine textual and hierarchical side information via a feature selection auto-encoder that selects discriminating side information within a same end-to-end model.

84,Context-Aware Crowd Counting,"State-of-the-art methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate crowd density. They typically use the same filters over the whole image or over large image patches. Only then do they estimate local scale to compensate for perspective distortion. This is typically achieved by training an auxiliary classifier to select, for predefined image patches, the best kernel size among a limited set of choices. As such, these methods are not end-to-end trainable and restricted in the scope of context they can leverage.  In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end trainable deep architecture that combines features obtained using multiple receptive field sizes and learns the importance of each such feature at each image location.  In other words, our approach adaptively encodes the scale of the contextual information required to accurately predict crowd density. This yields an algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art crowd counting methods, especially when perspective effects are strong.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Context-Aware,Crowd,Counting"
85,Detect-To-Retrieve: Efficient Regional Aggregation for Image Search,"Retrieving object instances among cluttered scenes efficiently requires compact yet comprehensive regional image representations. Intuitively, object semantics can help build the index that focuses on the most relevant regions. However, due to the lack of bounding-box datasets for objects of interest among retrieval benchmarks, most recent work on regional representations has focused on either uniform or class-agnostic region selection. In this paper, we first fill the void by providing a new dataset of landmark bounding boxes, based on the Google Landmarks dataset, that includes 94k images with manually curated boxes from 15k unique landmarks. Then, we demonstrate how a trained landmark detector, using our new dataset, can be leveraged to index image regions and improve retrieval accuracy while being much more efficient than existing regional methods. In addition, we introduce a novel regional aggregated selective match kernel (R-ASMK) to effectively combine information from detected regions into an improved holistic image representation. R-ASMK boosts image retrieval accuracy substantially with no dimensionality increase, while even outperforming systems that index image regions independently. Our complete image retrieval system improves upon the previous state-of-the-art by significant margins on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets. Code and data will be released.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Detect-To-Retrieve:,Efficient,Regional,Aggregation,for,Image,Search"
86,Towards Accurate One-Stage Object Detection With AP-Loss,"One-stage object detectors are trained by optimizing classification-loss and localization-loss simultaneously, with the former suffering much from extreme foreground-background class imbalance issue due to the large number of anchors. This paper alleviates this issue by proposing a novel framework to replace the classification task in one-stage detectors with a ranking task, and adopting the Average-Precision loss (AP-loss) for the ranking problem. Due to its non-differentiability and non-convexity, the AP-loss cannot be optimized directly. For this purpose, we develop a novel optimization algorithm, which seamlessly combines the error-driven update scheme in perceptron learning and backpropagation algorithm in deep networks. We verify good convergence property of the proposed algorithm theoretically and empirically. Experimental results demonstrate notable performance improvement in state-of-the-art one-stage detectors based on AP-loss over different kinds of classification-losses on various benchmarks, without changing the network architectures.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Accurate,One-Stage,Object,Detection,With,AP-Loss"
87,On Exploring Undetermined Relationships for Visual Relationship Detection,"In visual relationship detection, human-notated relationships can be regarded as determinate relationships. However, there are still large amount of unlabeled data, such as object pairs with less significant relationships or even with no relationships. We refer to these unlabeled but potentially useful data as undetermined relationships. Although a vast body of literature exists, few methods exploit these undetermined relationships for visual relationship detection.  In this paper, we explore the beneficial effect of undetermined relationships on visual relationship detection. We propose a novel multi-modal feature based undetermined relationship learning network (MF-URLN) and achieve great improvements in relationship detection. In detail, our MF-URLN automatically generates undetermined relationships by comparing object pairs with human-notated data according to a designed criterion. Then, the MF-URLN extracts and fuses features of object pairs from three complementary modals: visual, spatial, and linguistic modals. Further, the MF-URLN proposes two correlated subnetworks: one subnetwork decides the determinate confidence, and the other predicts the relationships. We evaluate the MF-URLN on two datasets: the Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) and the Visual Genome (VG) datasets. The experimental results compared with state-of-the-art methods verify the significant improvements made by the undetermined relationships, e.g., the top-50 relation detection recall improves from 19.5% to 23.9% on the VRD dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"On,Exploring,Undetermined,Relationships,for,Visual,Relationship,Detection"
88,Learning Without Memorizing,"Incremental learning (IL) is an important task aimed at increasing the capability of a trained model, in terms of the number of classes recognizable by the model. The key problem in this task is the requirement of storing data (e.g. images) associated with existing classes, while teaching the classifier to learn new classes. However, this is impractical as it increases the memory requirement at every incremental step, which makes it impossible to implement IL algorithms on edge devices with limited memory. Hence, we propose a novel approach, called `Learning without Memorizing (LwM)', to preserve the information about existing (base) classes, without storing any of their data, while making the classifier progressively learn the new classes. In LwM, we present an information preserving penalty: Attention Distillation Loss (L_ AD ), and demonstrate that penalizing the changes in classifiers' attention maps helps to retain information of the base classes, as new classes are added. We show that adding L_ AD  to the distillation loss which is an existing information preserving loss consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art performance in the iILSVRC-small and iCIFAR-100 datasets in terms of the overall accuracy of base and incrementally learned classes.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Without,Memorizing"
89,Dynamic Recursive Neural Network,"This paper proposes the dynamic recursive neural network (DRNN), which simplifies the duplicated building blocks in deep neural network. Different from forwarding through different blocks sequentially in previous networks, we demonstrate that the DRNN can achieve better performance with fewer blocks by employing block recursively. We further add a gate structure to each block, which can adaptively decide the loop times of recursive blocks to reduce the computational cost.  Since the recursive networks are hard to train, we propose the Loopy Variable Batch Normalization (LVBN) to stabilize the volatile gradient. Further, we improve the LVBN to correct statistical bias caused by the gate structure.  Experiments show that the DRNN reduces the parameters and computational cost and while outperforms the original model in term of the accuracy consistently on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k. Lastly we visualize and discuss the relation between image saliency and the number of loop time.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dynamic,Recursive,Neural,Network"
90,Destruction and Construction Learning for Fine-Grained Image Recognition,"Delicate feature representation about object parts plays a critical role in fine-grained recognition. For example, experts can even distinguish fine-grained objects relying only on object parts according to professional knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel ""Destruction and Construction Learning"" (DCL) method to enhance the difficulty of fine-grained recognition and exercise the classification model to acquire expert knowledge. Besides the standard classification backbone network, another ""destruction and construction"" stream is introduced to carefully ""destruct"" and then ""reconstruct"" the input image, for learning discriminative regions and features. More specifically, for ""destruction"", we first partition the input image into local regions and then shuffle them by a Region Confusion Mechanism (RCM). To correctly recognize these destructed images, the classification network has to pay more attention to discriminative regions for spotting the differences. To compensate the noises introduced by RCM, an adversarial loss, which distinguishes original images from destructed ones, is applied to reject noisy patterns introduced by RCM. For ""construction"", a region alignment network, which tries to restore the original spatial layout of local regions, is followed to model the semantic correlation among local regions. By jointly training with parameter sharing, our proposed DCL injects more discriminative local details to the classification network. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard benchmarks. Moreover, our proposed method does not need any external knowledge during training, and there is no computation overhead at inference time except the standard classification network feed-forwarding.

91,Distraction-Aware Shadow Detection,"Shadow detection is an important and challenging task for scene understanding. Despite promising results from recent deep learning based methods. Existing works still struggle with ambiguous cases where the visual appearances of shadow and non-shadow regions are similar (referred to as distraction in our context). In this paper, we propose a Distraction-aware Shadow Detection Network (DSDNet) by explicitly learning and integrating the semantics of visual distraction regions in an end-to-end framework. At the core of our framework is a novel standalone, differentiable Distraction-aware Shadow (DS) module, which allows us to learn distraction-aware, discriminative features for robust shadow detection, by explicitly predicting false positives and false negatives. We conduct extensive experiments on three public shadow detection datasets, SBU, UCF and ISTD, to evaluate our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can boost shadow detection performance, by effectively suppressing the detection of false positives and false negatives, achieving state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Distraction-Aware,Shadow,Detection"
92,Multi-Label Image Recognition With Graph Convolutional Networks,"The task of multi-label image recognition is to predict a set of object labels that present in an image. As objects normally co-occur in an image, it is desirable to model the label dependencies to improve the recognition performance. To capture and explore such important dependencies, we propose a multi-label classification model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The model builds a directed graph over the object labels, where each node (label) is represented by word embeddings of a label, and GCN is learned to map this label graph into a set of inter-dependent object classifiers. These classifiers are applied to the image descriptors extracted by another sub-net, enabling the whole network to be end-to-end trainable. Furthermore, we propose a novel re-weighted scheme to create an effective label correlation matrix to guide information propagation among the nodes in GCN. Experiments on two multi-label image recognition datasets show that our approach obviously outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, visualization analyses reveal that the classifiers learned by our model maintain meaningful semantic topology.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Label,Image,Recognition,With,Graph,Convolutional,Networks"
93,High-Level Semantic Feature Detection: A New Perspective for Pedestrian Detection,"Object detection generally requires sliding-window classifiers in tradition or anchor-based predictions in modern deep learning approaches. However, either of these approaches requires tedious configurations in windows or anchors. In this paper, taking pedestrian detection as an example, we provide a new perspective where detecting objects is motivated as a high-level semantic feature detection task. Like edges, corners, blobs and other feature detectors, the proposed detector scans for feature points all over the image, for which the convolution is naturally suited. However, unlike these traditional low-level features, the proposed detector goes for a higher-level abstraction, that is, we are looking for central points where there are pedestrians, and modern deep models are already capable of such a high-level semantic abstraction. Besides, like blob detection, we also predict the scales of the pedestrian points, which is also a straightforward convolution. Therefore, in this paper, pedestrian detection is simplified as a straightforward center and scale prediction task through convolutions. This way, the proposed method enjoys an anchor-free setting. Though structurally simple, it presents competitive accuracy and good speed on challenging pedestrian detection benchmarks, and hence leading to a new attractive pedestrian detector.

In this work, we propose a new method for DML that simultaneously learns the backbone network parameters, the embedding space, and the multi-modal distribution of each of the training categories in that space, in a single end-to-end training process. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for DML-based object classification on a variety of standard fine-grained datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the problem of few-shot object detection, by incorporating the proposed DML architecture as a classification head into a standard object detection model. We achieve the best results on the ImageNet-LOC dataset compared to strong baselines, when only a few training examples are available. We also offer the community a new episodic benchmark based on the ImageNet dataset for the few-shot object detection task.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"RepMet:,Representative-Based,Metric,Learning,for,Classification,and,Few-Shot,Object,Detection"
95,Ranked List Loss for Deep Metric Learning,"The objective of deep metric learning (DML) is to learn embeddings that can capture semantic similarity information among data points. Existing pairwise or tripletwise loss functions used in DML are known to suffer from slow convergence due to a large proportion of trivial pairs or triplets as the model improves. To improve this, rankingmotivated structured losses are proposed recently to incorporate multiple examples and exploit the structured information among them. They converge faster and achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we present two limitations of existing ranking-motivated structured losses and propose a novel ranked list loss to solve both of them. First, given a query, only a fraction of data points is incorporated to build the similarity structure. Consequently, some useful examples are ignored and the structure is less informative. To address this, we propose to build a setbased similarity structure by exploiting all instances in the gallery. The samples are split into a positive set and a negative set. Our objective is to make the query closer to the positive set than to the negative set by a margin. Second, previous methods aim to pull positive pairs as close as possible in the embedding space. As a result, the intraclass data distribution might be dropped. In contrast, we propose to learn a hypersphere for each class in order to preserve the similarity structure inside it. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely used benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Ranked,List,Loss,for,Deep,Metric,Learning"

In this paper, we present CANet, a class-agnostic segmentation network that performs few-shot segmentation on new classes with only a few annotated images available. Our network consists of a two-branch dense comparison module which performs multi-level feature comparison between the support image and the query image, and an iterative optimization module which iteratively refines the predicted results. Furthermore, we introduce an attention mechanism to effectively fuse information from multiple support examples under the setting of k-shot learning. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 show that our method achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union score of 55.4% for 1-shot segmentation and 57.1% for 5-shot segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of 14.6% and 13.2%, respectively.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CANet:,Class-Agnostic,Segmentation,Networks,With,Iterative,Refinement,and,Attentive,Few-Shot,Learning"

Our contributions include: (1) A layer for estimating the Jaccard index as a detection quality score; (2) a novel EM merging unit, which uses our quality scores to resolve detection overlap ambiguities; finally, (3) an extensive, annotated data set, SKU-110K, representing packed retail environments, released for training and testing under such extreme settings.

98,KE-GAN: Knowledge Embedded Generative Adversarial Networks for Semi-Supervised Scene Parsing,"In recent years, scene parsing has captured increasing attention in computer vision. Previous works have demonstrated promising performance in this task. However, they mainly utilize holistic features, whilst neglecting the rich semantic knowledge and inter-object relationships in the scene. In addition, these methods usually require a large number of pixel-level annotations, which is too expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge Embedded Generative Adversarial Networks, dubbed as KE-GAN, to tackle the challenging problem in a semi-supervised fashion. KE-GAN captures semantic consistencies of different categories by devising a Knowledge Graph from the large-scale text corpus. In addition to readily-available unlabeled data, we generate synthetic images to unveil rich structural information underlying the images. Moreover, a pyramid architecture is incorporated into the discriminator to acquire multi-scale contextual information for better parsing results. Extensive experimental results on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that KE-GAN is capable of improving semantic consistencies and learning better representations for scene parsing, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"KE-GAN:,Knowledge,Embedded,Generative,Adversarial,Networks,for,Semi-Supervised,Scene,Parsing"

Our method is built upon two core operations, interaction and propagation, and each operation is conducted by Convolutional Neural Networks. The two networks are connected both internally and externally so that the networks are trained jointly and interact with each other to solve the complex video object segmentation problem. We propose a new multi-round training scheme for the interactive video object segmentation so that the networks can learn how to understand the user's intention and update incorrect estimations during the training. At the testing time, our method produces high-quality results and also runs fast enough to work with users interactively.

101,FickleNet: Weakly and Semi-Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation Using Stochastic Inference,"The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the difficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level annotations. Most methods based on image-level annotations use localization maps obtained from the classifier, but these only focus on the small discriminative parts of objects and do not capture precise boundaries. FickleNet explores diverse combinations of locations on feature maps created by generic deep neural networks. It selects hidden units randomly and then uses them to obtain activation scores for image classification. FickleNet implicitly learns the coherence of each location in the feature maps, resulting in a localization map which identifies both discriminative and other parts of objects. The ensemble effects are obtained from a single network by selecting random hidden unit pairs, which means that a variety of localization maps are generated from a single image. Our approach does not require any additional training steps and only adds a simple layer to a standard convolutional neural network; nevertheless it outperforms recent comparable techniques on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark in both weakly and semi-supervised settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"FickleNet:,Weakly,and,Semi-Supervised,Semantic,Image,Segmentation,Using,Stochastic,Inference"

Our model incorporates recurrence on two different domains: (i) the spatial, which allows to discover the different object instances within a frame, and (ii) the temporal, which allows to keep the coherence of the segmented objects along time. We train RVOS for zero-shot video object segmentation and are the first ones to report quantitative results for DAVIS-2017 and YouTube-VOS benchmarks. Further, we adapt RVOS for one-shot video object segmentation by using the masks obtained in previous time steps as inputs to be processed by the recurrent module. Our model reaches comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques in YouTube-VOS benchmark and outperforms all previous video object segmentation methods not using online learning in the DAVIS-2017 benchmark.

Many recent methods frame object skeleton detection as a binary pixel classification problem, which is similar in spirit to learning-based edge detection, as well as to semantic segmentation methods. In the present article, we depart from this strategy by training a CNN to predict a two-dimensional vector field, which maps each scene point to a candidate skeleton pixel, in the spirit of flux-based skeletonization algorithms. This ""image context flux"" representation has two major advantages over previous approaches. First, it explicitly encodes the relative position of skeletal pixels to semantically meaningful entities, such as the image points in their spatial context, and hence also the implied object boundaries. Second, since the skeleton detection context is a region-based vector field, it is better able to cope with object parts of large width. We evaluate the proposed method on three benchmark datasets for skeleton detection and two for symmetry detection, achieving consistently superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DeepFlux,for,Skeletons,in,the,Wild"

Then, we perform the forward pass in a convolutional neural network, which outputs an initial segmentation map. However, the user-annotated locations can be mislabeled in the initial result. Therefore, we develop the backpropagating refinement scheme (BRS), which corrects the mislabeled pixels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms on four challenging datasets.

105,Scene Parsing via Integrated Classification Model and Variance-Based Regularization,"Scene Parsing is a challenging task in computer vision, which can be formulated as a pixel-wise classification problem. Existing deep-learning-based methods usually use one general classifier to recognize all object categories. However, the general classifier easily makes some mistakes in dealing with some confusing categories that share similar appearances or semantics. In this paper, we propose an integrated classification model and a variance-based regularization to achieve more accurate classifications. On the one hand, the integrated classification model contains multiple classifiers, not only the general classifier but also a refinement classifier to distinguish the confusing categories. On the other hand, the variance-based regularization differentiates the scores of all categories as large as possible to reduce misclassifications. Specifically, the integrated classification model includes three steps. The first is to extract the features of each pixel. Based on the features, the second step is to classify each pixel across all categories to generate a preliminary classification result. In the third step, we leverage a refinement classifier to refine the classification result, focusing on differentiating the high-preliminary-score categories. An integrated loss with the variance-based regularization is used to train the model.

Unlike previous works in measuring abstract reasoning using RPM, we establish a semantic link between vision and reasoning by providing structure representation. This addition enables a new type of abstract reasoning by jointly operating on the structure representation.

We fill in the gap by presenting DeepFashion2 to address these issues. It is a versatile benchmark of four tasks including clothes detection, pose estimation, segmentation, and retrieval. It has 801K clothing items where each item has rich annotations such as style, scale, view- point, occlusion, bounding box, dense landmarks (e.g. 39 for 'long sleeve outwear' and 15 for 'vest'), and masks.

109,Jumping Manifolds: Geometry Aware Dense Non-Rigid Structure From Motion,"Given dense image feature correspondences of a non-rigidly moving object across multiple frames, this paper proposes an algorithm to estimate its 3D shape for each frame.  To solve this problem accurately, the recent state-of-the-art algorithm reduces this task to set of local linear subspace reconstruction and clustering problem using Grassmann manifold representation [34]. Unfortunately, their method missed on some of the critical issues associated with the modeling of surface deformations, for e.g., the dependence of a local surface deformation on its neighbors. Furthermore, their representation to group high dimensional data points inevitably introduce the drawbacks of categorizing samples on the high-dimensional Grassmann manifold [32, 31]. Hence, to deal with such limitations with [34], we propose an algorithm that jointly exploits the benefit of high-dimensional Grassmann manifold to perform reconstruction, and its equivalent lower-dimensional representation to infer suitable clusters. To accomplish this, we project each Grassmannians onto a lower-dimensional Grassmann manifold which preserves and respects the deformation of the structure w.r.t its neighbors. These Grassmann points in the lower-dimension then act as a representative for the selection of high-dimensional Grassmann samples to perform each local reconstruction. In practice, our algorithm provides a geometrically efficient way to solve dense NRSfM by switching between manifolds based on its benefit and usage. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective in handling noise with reconstruction accuracy as good as or better than the competing methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Jumping,Manifolds:,Geometry,Aware,Dense,Non-Rigid,Structure,From,Motion"

Modern approaches rely on a hierarchical organization of the vocabulary to reduce annotation time, but remain expensive (several minutes per image for the 200 classes in ILSVRC). Instead, we propose a new interface where classes are annotated via speech. Speaking is fast and allows for direct access to the class name, without searching through a list or hierarchy. As additional advantages, annotators can simultaneously speak and scan the image for objects, the interface can be kept extremely simple, and using it requires less mouse movement. As annotators using our interface should only say words from a given class vocabulary, we propose a dedicated task to train them to do so. Through experiments on COCO and ILSVRC, we show our method yields high-quality annotations at 2.3x -14.9x less annotation time than existing methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fast,Object,Class,Labelling,via,Speech"
112,LaSOT: A High-Quality Benchmark for Large-Scale Single Object Tracking,"In this paper, we present LaSOT, a high-quality benchmark for Large-scale Single Object Tracking. LaSOT consists of 1,400 sequences with more than 3.5M frames in total. Each frame in these sequences is carefully and manually annotated with a bounding box, making LaSOT the largest, to the best of our knowledge, densely annotated tracking benchmark. The average video length of LaSOT is more than 2,500 frames, and each sequence comprises various challenges deriving from the wild where target objects may disappear and re-appear again in the view. By releasing LaSOT, we expect to provide the community with a large-scale dedicated benchmark with high quality for both the training of deep trackers and the veritable evaluation of tracking algorithms. Moreover, considering the close connections of visual appearance and natural language, we enrich LaSOT by providing additional language specification, aiming at encouraging the exploration of natural linguistic feature for tracking. A thorough experimental evaluation of 35 tracking algorithms on LaSOT is presented with detailed analysis, and the results demonstrate that there is still a big room for improvements.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LaSOT:,A,High-Quality,Benchmark,for,Large-Scale,Single,Object,Tracking"
113,Creative Flow+ Dataset,"We present the Creative Flow+ Dataset, the first diverse multi-style artistic video dataset richly labeled with per-pixel optical flow, occlusions, correspondences, segmentation labels, normals, and depth. Our dataset includes 3000 animated sequences rendered using styles randomly selected from 40 textured line styles and 38 shading styles, spanning the range between flat cartoon fill and wildly sketchy shading. Our dataset includes 124K+ train set frames and 10K test set frames rendered at 1500x1500 resolution, far surpassing the largest available optical flow datasets in size. While modern techniques for tasks such as optical flow estimation achieve impressive performance on realistic images and video, today there is no way to gauge their performance on non-photorealistic images. Creative Flow+ poses a new challenge to generalize real-world Computer Vision to messy stylized content. We show that learning-based optical flow methods fail to generalize to this data and struggle to compete with classical approaches, and invite new research in this area.  Our dataset and a new optical flow benchmark will be publicly available at: www.cs.toronto.edu/creativeflow/. We further release the complete dataset creation pipeline, allowing the community to generate and stylize their own data on demand.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Creative,Flow+,Dataset"
114,Weakly Supervised Open-Set Domain Adaptation by Dual-Domain Collaboration,"In conventional domain adaptation, a critical assumption is that there exists a fully labeled domain (source) that contains the same label space as another unlabeled or scarcely labeled domain (target). However, in the real world, there often exist application scenarios in which both domains are partially labeled and not all classes are shared between these two domains. Thus, it is meaningful to let partially labeled domains learn from each other to classify all the unlabeled samples in each domain under an open-set setting. We consider this problem as weakly supervised open-set domain adaptation. To address this practical setting, we propose the Collaborative Distribution Alignment (CDA) method, which performs knowledge transfer bilaterally and works collaboratively to classify unlabeled data and identify outlier samples. Extensive experiments on the Office benchmark and an application on person reidentification show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly,Supervised,Open-Set,Domain,Adaptation,by,Dual-Domain,Collaboration"
115,A Neurobiological Evaluation Metric for Neural Network Model Search,"Neuroscience theory posits that the brain's visual system coarsely identifies broad object categories via neural activation patterns, with similar objects producing similar neural responses. Artificial neural networks also have internal activation behavior in response to stimuli. We hypothesize that networks exhibiting brain-like activation behavior will demonstrate brain-like characteristics, e.g., stronger generalization capabilities. In this paper we introduce a human-model similarity (HMS) metric, which quantifies the similarity of human fMRI and network activation behavior. To calculate HMS, representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) are created as abstractions of activation behavior, measured by the correlations of activations to stimulus pairs. HMS is then the correlation between the fMRI RDM and the neural network RDM across all stimulus pairs. We test the metric on unsupervised predictive coding networks, which specifically model visual perception, and assess the metric for statistical significance over a large range of hyperparameters. Our experiments show that networks with increased human-model similarity are correlated with better performance on two computer vision tasks: next frame prediction and object matching accuracy. Further, HMS identifies networks with high performance on both tasks. An unexpected secondary finding is that the metric can be employed during training as an early-stopping mechanism.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Neurobiological,Evaluation,Metric,for,Neural,Network,Model,Search"
116,Iterative Projection and Matching: Finding Structure-Preserving Representatives and Its Application to Computer Vision,"The goal of data selection is to capture the most structural information from a set of data. This paper presents a fast and accurate data selection method, in which the selected samples are optimized to span the subspace of all data. We propose a new selection algorithm, referred to as iterative projection and matching (IPM), with linear complexity w.r.t. the number of data, and without any parameter to be tuned. In our algorithm,  at each iteration, the maximum information from the structure of the data is captured by one selected sample, and the captured information is neglected in the next iterations by projection on the null-space of previously selected samples. The computational efficiency and the selection accuracy of our proposed algorithm outperform those of the conventional methods. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is shown on active learning for video action recognition dataset on UCF-101; learning using representatives on ImageNet; training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate multi-view images from a single-view input on CMU Multi-PIE dataset; and video summarization on UTE Egocentric dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Iterative,Projection,and,Matching:,Finding,Structure-Preserving,Representatives,and,Its,Application,to,Computer,Vision"
117,Efficient Multi-Domain Learning by Covariance Normalization,"The problem of multi-domain learning of deep networks is considered. An adaptive layer is induced per target domain and a novel procedure, denoted covariance normalization (CovNorm), proposed to reduce its parameters. CovNorm is a data driven method of fairly simple implementation, requiring two principal component analyzes (PCA) and fine-tuning of a mini-adaptation layer. Nevertheless, it is shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to have several advantages over previous approaches, such as batch normalization or geometric matrix approximations. Furthermore, CovNorm can be deployed both when target datasets are available sequentially or simultaneously. Experiments show that, in both cases, it has performance comparable to a fully fine-tuned network, using as few as 0.13% of the corresponding parameters per target domain.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Efficient,Multi-Domain,Learning,by,Covariance,Normalization"
118,Predicting Visible Image Differences Under Varying Display Brightness and Viewing Distance,"Numerous applications require a robust metric that can predict whether image differences are visible or not. However, the accuracy of existing white-box visibility metrics, such as HDR-VDP, is often not good enough. CNN-based black-box visibility metrics have proven to be more accurate, but they cannot account for differences in viewing conditions, such as display brightness and viewing distance.  In this paper, we propose a CNN-based visibility metric, which maintains the accuracy of deep network solutions and accounts for viewing conditions. To achieve this, we extend the existing dataset of locally visible differences (LocVis) with a new set of measurements, collected considering aforementioned viewing conditions. Then, we develop a hybrid model that combines white-box processing stages for modeling the effects of luminance masking and contrast sensitivity, with a black-box deep neural network.  We demonstrate that the novel hybrid model can handle the change of viewing conditions correctly and outperforms state-of-the-art metrics.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Predicting,Visible,Image,Differences,Under,Varying,Display,Brightness,and,Viewing,Distance"
119,A Bayesian Perspective on the Deep Image Prior,"The deep image prior was recently introduced as a prior for natural images. It represents images as the output of a convolutional network with random inputs. For ""inference"", gradient descent is performed to adjust network parameters to make the output match observations. This approach yields good performance on a range of image reconstruction tasks. We show that the deep image prior is asymptotically equivalent to a stationary Gaussian process prior in the limit as the number of channels in each layer of the network goes to infinity, and derive the corresponding kernel. This informs a Bayesian approach to inference. We show that by conducting posterior inference using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics we avoid the need for early stopping, which is a drawback of the current approach, and improve results for denoising and impainting tasks. We illustrate these intuitions on a number of 1D and 2D signal reconstruction tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Bayesian,Perspective,on,the,Deep,Image,Prior"
120,ApolloCar3D: A Large 3D Car Instance Understanding Benchmark for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous driving has attracted remarkable attention from both industry and academia. An important task is to estimate 3D properties (e.g. translation, rotation and shape) of a moving or parked vehicle on the road. This task, while critical, is still under-researched in the computer vision community - partially owing to the lack of large scale and fully-annotated 3D car database suitable for autonomous driving research. In this paper, we contribute the first large scale database suitable for 3D car instance understanding - ApolloCar3D. The dataset contains 5,277 driving images and over 60K car instances, where each car is fitted with an industry-grade 3D CAD model with absolute model size and semantically labelled keypoints. This dataset is above 20x larger than PASCAL3D+ and KITTI, the current state-of-the-art. To enable efficient labelling in 3D, we build a pipeline by considering 2D-3D keypoint correspondences for a single instance and 3D relationship among multiple instances. Equipped with such dataset, we build various baseline algorithms with the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we first segment each car with a pre-trained Mask R-CNN, and then regress towards its 3D pose and shape based on a deformable 3D car model with or without using semantic keypoints. We show that using keypoints significantly improves fitting performance. Finally, we develop a new 3D metric jointly considering 3D pose and 3D shape, allowing for comprehensive evaluation and ablation study.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ApolloCar3D:,A,Large,3D,Car,Instance,Understanding,Benchmark,for,Autonomous,Driving"
121,Compressing Unknown Images With Product Quantizer for Efficient Zero-Shot Classification,"For Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), the Nearest Neighbor (NN) search is generally conducted for classification, which may cause unacceptable computational complexity for large-scale datasets. To compress zero-shot classes by the trained quantizer for efficient search, it tends to induce large quantization error because distributions between seen and unseen classes are different. However, as semantic attributes of classes are available in ZSL, both seen and unseen classes have the same distribution for one specific property, e.g., animals have or not have spots. Based on this intuition, a Product Quantization Zero-Shot Learning (PQZSL) method is proposed to learn embeddings as well as quantizers to compress visual features into compact codes for Approximate NN (ANN) search. Particularly, visual features are projected into an orthogonal semantic space, and then the Product Quantization (PQ) is utilized to quantize individual properties. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that unseen classes are represented by the Cartesian product of quantized properties with little quantization error. As classes in orthogonal common space are more discriminative, the classification based on PQZSL achieves state-of-the-art performance in Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) task, meanwhile, the speed of ANN search is 10-100 times higher than traditional NN search.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Compressing,Unknown,Images,With,Product,Quantizer,for,Efficient,Zero-Shot,Classification"
122,Self-Supervised Convolutional Subspace Clustering Network,"Subspace clustering methods based on data self-expression have become very popular for learning from data that lie in a union of low-dimensional linear subspaces. However, the applicability of subspace clustering has been limited because practical visual data in raw form do not necessarily lie in such linear subspaces. On the other hand, while Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for extracting discriminative features from visual data, training such a ConvNet usually requires a large amount of labeled data, which are unavailable in subspace clustering applications. To achieve simultaneous feature learning and subspace clustering, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework, called Self-Supervised Convolutional Subspace Clustering Network (S^2ConvSCN), that combines a ConvNet module (for feature learning), a self-expression module (for subspace clustering) and a spectral clustering module (for self-supervision) into a joint optimization framework. Particularly, we introduce a dual self-supervision that exploits the output of spectral clustering to supervise the training of the feature learning module (via a classification loss) and the self-expression module (via a spectral clustering loss). Our experiments on four benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the dual self-supervision and demonstrate superior performance of our proposed approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Supervised,Convolutional,Subspace,Clustering,Network"

We first present our basic multi-view stereo method with Adaptive Checkerboard sampling and Multi-Hypothesis joint view selection (ACMH). It leverages structured region information to sample better candidate hypotheses for propagation and infer the aggregation view subset at each pixel. For the depth estimation of low-textured areas, we further propose to combine ACMH with multi-scale geometric consistency guidance (ACMM) to obtain the reliable depth estimates for low-textured areas at coarser scales and guarantee that they can be propagated to finer scales. To correct the erroneous estimates propagated from the coarser scales, we present a novel detail restorer. Experiments on extensive datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, recovering the depth estimation not only in low-textured areas but also in details.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Scale,Geometric,Consistency,Guided,Multi-View,Stereo"
124,Privacy Preserving Image-Based Localization,"Image-based localization is a core component of many augmented/mixed reality (AR/MR) and autonomous robotic systems. Current localization systems rely on the persistent storage of 3D point clouds of the scene to enable camera pose estimation, but such data reveals potentially sensitive scene information. This gives rise to significant privacy risks, especially as for many applications 3D mapping is a background process that the user might not be fully aware of. We pose the following question: How can we avoid disclosing confidential information about the captured 3D scene, and yet allow reliable camera pose estimation? This paper proposes the first solution to what we call privacy preserving image-based localization. The key idea of our approach is to lift the map representation from a 3D point cloud to a 3D line cloud. This novel representation obfuscates the underlying scene geometry while providing sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments on several datasets and localization scenarios underline the high practical relevance of our proposed approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Privacy,Preserving,Image-Based,Localization"

Our main contributions are: (i) a multi-layer representation of garments and body, and (ii) a physics-based performance capture procedure. We first digitize the performer using multi-layer surface representation, which includes the undressed body surface and separate clothing meshes. For performance capture, we perform skeleton tracking, cloth simulation, and iterative depth fitting sequentially for the incoming frame. By incorporating cloth simulation into the performance capture pipeline, we can simulate plausible cloth dynamics and cloth-body interactions even in the occluded regions, which was not possible in previous capture methods. Moreover, by formulating depth fitting as a physical process, our system produces cloth tracking results consistent with the depth observation while still maintaining physical constraints. Results and evaluations show the effectiveness of our method. Our method also enables new types of applications such as cloth retargeting, free-viewpoint video rendering and animations.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SimulCap,:,Single-View,Human,Performance,Capture,With,Cloth,Simulation"
126,Hierarchical Deep Stereo Matching on High-Resolution Images,"We explore the problem of real-time stereo matching on high-res imagery. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle to process high-res imagery because of memory constraints or speed limitations. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework that searches for correspondences incrementally over a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. Because high-res stereo datasets are relatively rare, we introduce a dataset with high-res stereo pairs for both training and evaluation. Our approach achieved SOTA performance on Middlebury-v3 and KITTI-15 while running significantly faster than its competitors. The hierarchical design also naturally allows for anytime on-demand reports of disparity by capping intermediate coarse results, allowing us to accurately predict disparity for near-range structures with low latency (30ms). We demonstrate that the performance-vs-speed tradeoff afforded by on-demand hierarchies may address sensing needs for time-critical applications such as autonomous driving.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hierarchical,Deep,Stereo,Matching,on,High-Resolution,Images"
127,Recurrent MVSNet for High-Resolution Multi-View Stereo Depth Inference,"Deep learning has recently demonstrated its excellent performance for multi-view stereo (MVS). However, one major limitation of current learned MVS approaches is the scalability: the memory-consuming cost volume regularization makes the learned MVS hard to be applied to high-resolution scenes. In this paper, we introduce a scalable multi-view stereo framework based on the recurrent neural network. Instead of regularizing the entire 3D cost volume in one go, the proposed Recurrent Multi-view Stereo Network (R-MVSNet) sequentially regularizes the 2D cost maps along the depth direction via the gated recurrent unit (GRU). This reduces dramatically the memory consumption and makes high-resolution reconstruction feasible. We first show the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the proposed R-MVSNet on the recent MVS benchmarks. Then, we further demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method on several large-scale scenarios, where previous learned approaches often fail due to the memory constraint.

128,Synthesizing 3D Shapes From Silhouette Image Collections Using Multi-Projection Generative Adversarial Networks,"We present a new weakly supervised learning-based method for generating novel category-specific 3D shapes from unoccluded image collections. Our method is weakly supervised and only requires silhouette annotations from unoccluded, category-specific objects. Our method does not require access to the object's 3D shape, multiple observations per object from different views, intra-image pixel correspondences, or any view annotations. Key to our method is a novel multi-projection generative adversarial network (MP-GAN) that trains a 3D shape generator to be consistent with multiple 2D projections of the 3D shapes, and without direct access to these 3D shapes. This is achieved through multiple discriminators that encode the distribution of 2D projections of the 3D shapes seen from a different views. Additionally, to determine the view information for each silhouette image, we also train a view prediction network on visualizations of 3D shapes synthesized by the generator. We iteratively alternate between training the generator and training the view prediction network. We validate our multi-projection GAN on both synthetic and real image datasets. Furthermore, we also show that multi-projection GANs can aid in learning other high-dimensional distributions from lower dimensional training datasets, such as material-class specific spatially varying reflectance properties from images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Synthesizing,3D,Shapes,From,Silhouette,Image,Collections,Using,Multi-Projection,Generative,Adversarial,Networks"

The latter is computed per interest point and aligned to the local reference frame (LRF) to achieve rotation invariance. Our compact, learned, rotation invariant 3D point cloud descriptor achieves 94.9% average recall on the 3DMatch benchmark data set, outperforming the state-of-the-art by more than 20 percent points with only 32 output dimensions. This very low output dimension allows for near realtime correspondence search with 0.1 ms per feature point on a standard PC. Our approach is sensor- and scene-agnostic because of SDV, LRF and learning highly descriptive features with fully convolutional layers. We show that 3DSmoothNet trained only on RGB-D indoor scenes of buildings achieves 79.0% average recall on laser scans of outdoor vegetation, more than double the performance of our closest, learning-based competitors.

We propose a learning-based, multi-view dense depth map and odometry estimation method that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and trains utilizing multi-view image reprojection and forward-backward flow-consistency losses. Our model can be trained in a supervised or even  unsupervised mode. It is designed for depth and visual odometry estimation from video where the input frames are temporally correlated.

Unlike previous work, we densely connect each point with every other in a local neighborhood, aiming to specify feature of each point based on the local region characteristics for better representing the region. A novel module, namely Adaptive Feature Adjustment (AFA) module, is presented to find the interaction between points. For each local region, an impact map carrying element-wise impact between point pairs is applied to the feature difference map. Each feature is then pulled or pushed by other features in the same region according to the adaptively learned impact indicators. The adjusted features are well encoded with region information, and thus benefit the point cloud recognition tasks, such as point cloud segmentation and classification.

132,Scan2Mesh: From Unstructured Range Scans to 3D Meshes,"We introduce Scan2Mesh, a novel data-driven generative approach which transforms an unstructured and potentially incomplete range scan into a structured 3D mesh representation. The main contribution of this work is a generative neural network architecture whose input is a range scan of a 3D object and whose output is an indexed face set conditioned on the input scan. In order to generate a 3D mesh as a set of vertices and face indices, the generative model builds on a series of proxy losses for vertices, edges, and faces. At each stage, we realize a one-to-one discrete mapping between the predicted and ground truth data points with a combination of convolutional- and graph neural network architectures. This enables our algorithm to predict a compact mesh representation similar to those created through manual artist effort using 3D modeling software. Our generated mesh results thus produce sharper, cleaner meshes with a fundamentally different structure from those generated through implicit functions, a first step in bridging the gap towards artist-created CAD models.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Scan2Mesh:,From,Unstructured,Range,Scans,to,3D,Meshes"

While various traditional approaches for ToF data improvement have been proposed, machine learning techniques have seldom been applied to this task, mostly due to the limited availability of real world training data with depth  ground truth. In this paper, we avoid to rely on labeled real data in the learning framework. A Coarse-Fine CNN, able to exploit multi-frequency ToF data for MPI correction, is trained on synthetic data with ground truth in a supervised way. In parallel, an adversarial learning strategy, based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework, is used to perform an unsupervised pixel-level domain adaptation  from synthetic to real world data, exploiting unlabeled real world acquisitions.

Our network takes the 3D geometry of the problem into account which allows it to correlate the input images and distinguish moving objects from static ones.

136,Learning 3D Human Dynamics From Video,"From an image of a person in action, we can easily guess the 3D motion of the person in the immediate past and future. This is because we have a mental model of 3D human dynamics that we have acquired from observing visual sequences of humans in motion. We present a framework that can similarly learn a representation of 3D dynamics of humans from video via a simple but effective temporal encoding of image features.  At test time, from  video,  the  learned  temporal  representation  give rise to smooth 3D mesh predictions. From a single image, our model can recover the current 3D mesh as well as its 3D past and future motion. Our approach is designed so it can learn from videos with 2D pose annotations in a semi-supervised manner. Though annotated data is always limited, there are millions of videos uploaded daily on the Internet. In this work, we harvest this Internet-scale source of unlabeled data by training our model on unlabeled video with pseudo-ground truth 2D pose obtained from an off-the-shelf 2D pose detector. Our experiments show that adding more videos with pseudo-ground truth 2D pose monotonically improves 3D prediction performance. We evaluate our model on the recent challenging dataset of 3D Poses in the Wild and obtain state-of-the-art performance on the 3D prediction task without any fine-tuning.

137,Lending Orientation to Neural Networks for Cross-View Geo-Localization,"This paper studies image-based geo-localization (IBL) problem using ground-to-aerial cross-view matching.  The goal is to predict the spatial location of a ground-level query image by matching it to a large geotagged aerial image database (e.g., satellite imagery).  This is a challenging task due to the drastic differences in their viewpoints and visual appearances. Existing deep learning methods for this problem have been focused on maximizing feature similarity between spatially close-by image pairs, while minimizing other images pairs which are far apart. They do so by deep feature embedding based on visual appearance in those ground-and-aerial images.  However, in everyday life, humans commonly use orientation information as an important cue for the task of spatial localization.  Inspired by this insight, this paper proposes a novel method which endows deep neural networks with the `commonsense' of orientation.  Given a ground-level spherical panoramic image as query input (and a large georeferenced satellite image database), we design a Siamese network which explicitly encodes the orientation (i.e., spherical directions) of each pixel of the images. Our method significantly boosts the discriminative power of the learned deep features, leading to a much higher recall and precision outperforming all previous methods.  Our network is also more compact using only 1/5th number of parameters than a previously best-performing network.  To evaluate the generalization of our method, we also created a large-scale cross-view localization benchmark containing 100K geotagged ground-aerial pairs covering a city.

138,Visual Localization by Learning Objects-Of-Interest Dense Match Regression,"We introduce a novel CNN-based approach for visual localization from a single RGB image that relies on densely matching a set of Objects-of-Interest (OOIs). In this paper, we focus on planar objects which are highly descriptive in an environment, such as paintings in museums or logos and storefronts in malls or airports. For each OOI, we define a reference image for which 3D world coordinates are available. Given a query image, our CNN model detects the OOIs, segments them and finds a dense set of 2D-2D matches between each detected OOI and its corresponding reference image. Given these 2D-2D matches, together with the 3D world coordinates of each reference image, we obtain a set of 2D-3D matches from which solving a Perspective-n-Point problem gives a pose estimate. We show that 2D-3D matches for reference images, as well as OOI annotations can be obtained for all training images from a single instance annotation per OOI by leveraging Structure-from-Motion reconstruction. We introduce a novel synthetic dataset, VirtualGallery, which targets challenges such as varying lighting conditions and different occlusion levels. Our results show that our method achieves high precision and is robust to these challenges. We also experiment using the Baidu localization dataset captured in a shopping mall. Our approach is the first deep regression-based method to scale to such a larger environment.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Visual,Localization,by,Learning,Objects-Of-Interest,Dense,Match,Regression"
139,Bilateral Cyclic Constraint and Adaptive Regularization for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Prediction,"Supervised learning methods to infer (hypothesize) depth of a scene from a single image require costly per-pixel ground-truth. We follow a geometric approach that exploits abundant stereo imagery to learn a model to hypothesize scene structure without direct supervision. Although we train a network with stereo pairs, we only require a single image at test time to hypothesize disparity or depth. We propose a novel objective function that exploits the bilateral cyclic relationship between the left and right disparities and we introduce an adaptive regularization scheme that allows the network to handle both the co-visible and occluded regions in a stereo pair. This process ultimately produces a model to generate hypotheses for the 3-dimensional structure of the scene as viewed in a single image. When used to generate a single (most probable) estimate of depth, our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised monocular depth prediction methods on the KITTI benchmarks. We show that our method generalizes well by applying our models trained on KITTI to the Make3d dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bilateral,Cyclic,Constraint,and,Adaptive,Regularization,for,Unsupervised,Monocular,Depth,Prediction"
140,Face Parsing With RoI Tanh-Warping,"Face parsing computes pixel-wise label maps for different semantic components (e.g., hair, mouth, eyes) from face images. Existing face parsing literature have illustrated significant advantages by focusing on individual regions of interest (RoIs) for faces and facial components. However,the traditional crop-and-resize focusing mechanism ignores all contextual area outside the RoIs, and thus is not suitable when the component area is unpredictable, e.g. hair. Inspired by the physiological vision system of human, we propose a novel RoI Tanh-warping operator that combines the central vision and the peripheral vision together. It addresses the dilemma between a limited sized RoI for focusing and an unpredictable area of surrounding context for peripheral information. To this end, we propose a novel hybrid convolutional neural network for face parsing. It uses hierarchical local based method for inner facial components and global methods for outer facial components. The whole framework is simple and principled, and can be trained end-to-end. To facilitate future research of face parsing, we also manually relabel the training data of the HELEN dataset and will make it public. Experiments on both HELEN and LFW-PL benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Face,Parsing,With,RoI,Tanh-Warping"
141,Multi-Person Articulated Tracking With Spatial and Temporal Embeddings,"We propose a unified framework for multi-person pose estimation and tracking. Our framework consists of two main components, i.e. SpatialNet and TemporalNet. The SpatialNet accomplishes body part detection and part-level data association in a single frame, while the TemporalNet groups human instances in consecutive frames into trajectories. Specifically, besides body part detection heatmaps, SpatialNet also predicts the Keypoint Embedding (KE) and Spatial Instance Embedding (SIE) for body part association. We model the grouping procedure into a differentiable Pose-Guided Grouping (PGG) module to make the whole part detection and grouping pipeline fully end-to-end trainable. TemporalNet extends the spatial grouping of keypoints to temporal grouping of human instances. Given human proposals from two consecutive frames, TemporalNet exploits both appearance features encoded in Human Embedding (HE) and temporally consistent geometric features embodied in Temporal Instance Embedding (TIE) for robust tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Remarkably, we demonstrate substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art pose tracking method from 65.4% to 71.8% Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) on the ICCV'17 PoseTrack Dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Person,Articulated,Tracking,With,Spatial,and,Temporal,Embeddings"
142,Multi-Person Pose Estimation With Enhanced Channel-Wise and Spatial Information,"Multi-person pose estimation is an important but challenging problem in computer vision. Although current approaches have achieved significant progress by fusing the multi-scale feature maps, they pay little attention to enhancing the channel-wise and spatial information of the feature maps. In this paper, we propose two novel modules to perform the enhancement of the information for the multi-person pose estimation. First, a Channel Shuffle Module (CSM) is proposed to adopt the channel shuffle operation on the feature maps with different levels, promoting cross-channel information communication among the pyramid feature maps. Second, a Spatial, Channel-wise Attention Residual Bottleneck (SCARB) is designed to boost the original residual unit with attention mechanism, adaptively highlighting the information of the feature maps both in the spatial and channel-wise context. The effectiveness of our proposed modules is evaluated on the COCO keypoint benchmark, and experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Person,Pose,Estimation,With,Enhanced,Channel-Wise,and,Spatial,Information"
143,A Compact Embedding for Facial Expression Similarity,"Most of the existing work on automatic facial expression analysis focuses on discrete emotion recognition, or facial action unit detection. However, facial expressions do not always fall neatly into pre-defined semantic categories. Also, the similarity between expressions measured in the action unit space need not correspond to how humans perceive expression similarity. Different from previous work, our goal is to describe facial expressions in a continuous fashion using a compact embedding space that mimics human visual preferences. To achieve this goal, we collect a large-scale faces-in-the-wild dataset with human annotations in the form: Expressions A and B are visually more similar when compared to expression C, and use this dataset to train a neural network that produces a compact (16-dimensional) expression embedding. We experimentally demonstrate that the learned embedding can be successfully used for various applications such as expression retrieval, photo album summarization, and emotion recognition. We also show that the embedding learned using the proposed dataset performs better than several other embeddings learned using existing emotion or action unit datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Compact,Embedding,for,Facial,Expression,Similarity"
144,Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation,"In this paper, we are interested in the human pose estimation problem with a focus on learning reliable high-resolution representations. Most existing methods recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations produced by a high-to-low resolution network. Instead, our proposed network maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage, gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages, and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks in parallel. We conduct repeated multi-scale fusions such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over, leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result, the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the superior pose estimation results over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset. In addition, we show the superiority of our network in pose tracking on the PoseTrack dataset. The code and models have been publicly available at https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,High-Resolution,Representation,Learning,for,Human,Pose,Estimation"
145,Feature Transfer Learning for Face Recognition With Under-Represented Data,"Despite the large volume of face recognition datasets, there is a significant portion of subjects, of which the samples are insufficient and thus under-represented. Ignoring such significant portion results in insufficient training data. Training with under-represented data leads to biased classifiers in conventionally-trained deep networks. In this paper, we propose a center-based feature transfer framework to augment the feature space of under-represented subjects from the regular subjects that have sufficiently diverse samples. A Gaussian prior of the variance is assumed across all subjects and the variance from regular ones are transferred to the under-represented ones. This encourages the under-represented distribution to be closer to the regular distribution. Further, an alternating training regimen is proposed to simultaneously achieve less biased classifiers and a more discriminative feature representation. We conduct ablative study to mimic the under-represented datasets by varying the portion of under-represented classes on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. Advantageous results on LFW, IJB-A and MS-Celeb-1M demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature transfer and training strategy, compared to both general baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our feature transfer successfully presents smooth visual interpolation, which conducts disentanglement to preserve identity of a class while augmenting its feature space with non-identity variations such as pose and lighting.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Feature,Transfer,Learning,for,Face,Recognition,With,Under-Represented,Data"
146,Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation With Geometric Self-Supervision,"We present an unsupervised learning approach to re- cover 3D human pose from 2D skeletal joints extracted from a single image. Our method does not require any multi- view image data, 3D skeletons, correspondences between 2D-3D points, or use previously learned 3D priors during training. A lifting network accepts 2D landmarks as inputs and generates a corresponding 3D skeleton estimate. Dur- ing training, the recovered 3D skeleton is reprojected on random camera viewpoints to generate new 'synthetic' 2D poses. By lifting the synthetic 2D poses back to 3D and re-projecting them in the original camera view, we can de- fine self-consistency loss both in 3D and in 2D. The training can thus be self supervised by exploiting the geometric self- consistency of the lift-reproject-lift process. We show that self-consistency alone is not sufficient to generate realistic skeletons, however adding a 2D pose discriminator enables the lifter to output valid 3D poses. Additionally, to learn from 2D poses 'in the wild', we train an unsupervised 2D domain adapter network to allow for an expansion of 2D data. This improves results and demonstrates the useful- ness of 2D pose data for unsupervised 3D lifting. Results on Human3.6M dataset for 3D human pose estimation demon- strate that our approach improves upon the previous un- supervised methods by 30% and outperforms many weakly supervised approaches that explicitly use 3D data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,3D,Pose,Estimation,With,Geometric,Self-Supervision"

Motivated by this idea, this paper studies predicting a pedestrian's future path jointly with future activities. We propose an end-to-end, multi-task learning system utilizing rich visual features about human behavioral information and interaction with their surroundings. To facilitate the training, the network is learned with an auxiliary task of predicting future location in which the activity will happen. Experimental results demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance over two public benchmarks on future trajectory prediction. Moreover, our method is able to produce meaningful future activity prediction in addition to the path. The result provides the first empirical evidence that joint modeling of paths and activities benefits future path prediction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Peeking,Into,the,Future:,Predicting,Future,Person,Activities,and,Locations,in,Videos"
148,Re-Identification With Consistent Attentive Siamese Networks,"We propose a new deep architecture for person re-identification (re-id). While re-id has seen much recent progress, spatial localization and view-invariant representation learning for robust cross-view matching remain key, unsolved problems. We address these questions by means of a new attention-driven Siamese learning architecture, called the Consistent Attentive Siamese Network. Our key innovations compared to existing, competing methods include (a) a flexible framework design that produces attention with only identity labels as supervision, (b) explicit mechanisms to enforce attention consistency among images of the same person, and (c) a new Siamese framework that integrates attention and attention consistency, producing principled supervisory signals as well as the first mechanism that can explain the reasoning behind the Siamese framework's predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations on the CUHK03-NP, DukeMTMC-ReID, and Market-1501 datasets and report competitive performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Re-Identification,With,Consistent,Attentive,Siamese,Networks"
149,On the Continuity of Rotation Representations in Neural Networks,"In neural networks, it is often desirable to work with various representations of the same space. For example, 3D rotations can be represented with quaternions or Euler angles. In this paper, we advance a  definition of a continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difficult for neural networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also present continuous representations for the general case of the n-dimensional rotation group SO(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and similarity transforms. We finally present empirical results, which show that our continuous rotation representations outperform discontinuous ones for several practical problems in graphics and vision, including a simple autoencoder sanity test, a rotation estimator for 3D point clouds, and an inverse kinematics solver for 3D human poses.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"On,the,Continuity,of,Rotation,Representations,in,Neural,Networks"
150,Iterative Residual Refinement for Joint Optical Flow and Occlusion Estimation,"Deep learning approaches to optical flow estimation have seen rapid progress over the recent years. One common trait of many networks is that they refine an initial flow estimate either through multiple stages or across the levels of a coarse-to-fine representation. While leading to more accurate results, the downside of this is an increased number of parameters. Taking inspiration from both classical energy minimization approaches as well as residual networks, we propose an iterative residual refinement (IRR) scheme based on weight sharing that can be combined with several backbone networks. It reduces the number of parameters, improves the accuracy, or even achieves both. Moreover, we show that integrating occlusion prediction and bi-directional flow estimation into our IRR scheme can further boost the accuracy. Our full network achieves state-of-the-art results for both optical flow and occlusion estimation across several standard datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Iterative,Residual,Refinement,for,Joint,Optical,Flow,and,Occlusion,Estimation"
151,Inverse Discriminative Networks for Handwritten Signature Verification,"Handwritten signature verification is an important technique for many financial, commercial, and forensic applications. In this paper, we propose an inverse discriminative network (IDN) for writer-independent handwritten signature verification, which aims to determine whether a test signature is genuine or forged compared to the reference signature. The IDN model contains four weight-shared neural network streams, of which two receiving the original signature images are the discriminative streams and the other two addressing the gray-inverted images form the inverse streams. Multiple paths of attention modules connect the discriminative streams and the inverse streams to propagate messages. With the inverse streams and the multi-path attention modules, the IDN model intensifies the effective information of signature verification. Since there was no proper Chinese signature dataset in the community, we collected a large-scale Chinese signature dataset with approximately 29,000 images of 749 individuals' signatures. We test our method on the Chinese signature dataset and other three signature datasets of different languages: CEDAR, BHSig-B, and BHSig-H. Experiments prove the strength and potential of our method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Inverse,Discriminative,Networks,for,Handwritten,Signature,Verification"
152,Led3D: A Lightweight and Efficient Deep Approach to Recognizing Low-Quality 3D Faces,"Due to the intrinsic invariance to pose and illumination changes, 3D Face Recognition (FR) has a promising potential in the real world. 3D FR using high-quality faces, which are of high resolutions and with smooth surfaces, have been widely studied. However, research on that with low-quality input is limited, although it involves more applications. In this paper, we focus on 3D FR using low-quality data, targeting an efficient and accurate deep learning solution. To achieve this, we work on two aspects: (1) designing a lightweight yet powerful CNN; (2) generating finer and bigger training data. For (1), we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module and a Spatial Attention Vectorization (SAV) module to build a compact and discriminative CNN. For (2), we propose a data processing system including point-cloud recovery, surface refinement, and data augmentation (with newly proposed shape jittering and shape scaling). We conduct extensive experiments on Lock3DFace and achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming many heavy CNNs such as VGG-16 and ResNet-34.

153,ROI Pooled Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking,"The ROI (region-of-interest) based pooling method performs pooling operations on the cropped ROI regions for various samples and has shown great success in the object detection methods. It compresses the model size while preserving the localization accuracy, thus it is useful in the visual tracking field. Though being effective, the ROI-based pooling operation is not yet considered in the correlation filter formula. In this paper, we propose a novel ROI pooled correlation filter (RPCF) algorithm for robust visual tracking. Through mathematical derivations, we show that the ROI-based pooling can be equivalently achieved by enforcing additional constraints on the learned filter weights, which makes the ROI-based pooling feasible on the virtual circular samples. Besides, we develop an efficient joint training formula for the proposed correlation filter algorithm, and derive the Fourier solvers for efficient model training. Finally, we evaluate our RPCF tracker on OTB-2013, OTB-2015 and VOT-2017 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our tracker performs favourably against other state-of-the-art trackers.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ROI,Pooled,Correlation,Filters,for,Visual,Tracking"

Despite tremendous progress of deep neural networks for image inpainting, it is challenging to extend these methods to the video domain due to the additional time dimension. In this work, we propose a novel deep network architecture for fast video inpainting. Built upon an image-based encoder-decoder model, our framework is designed to collect and refine information from neighbor frames and synthesize still-unknown regions. At the same time, the output is enforced to be temporally consistent by a recurrent feedback and a temporal memory module. Compared with the state-of-the-art image inpainting algorithm, our method produces videos that are much more semantically correct and temporally smooth. In contrast to the prior video completion method which relies on time-consuming optimization, our method runs in near real-time while generating competitive video results. Finally, we applied our framework to video retargeting task, and obtain visually pleasing results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Video,Inpainting"
155,DM-GAN: Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-To-Image Synthesis,"In this paper, we focus on generating realistic images from text descriptions. Current methods first generate an initial image with rough shape and color, and then refine the initial image to a high-resolution one. Most existing text-to-image synthesis methods have two main problems. (1) These methods depend heavily on the quality of the initial images. If the initial image is not well initialized, the following processes can hardly refine the image to a satisfactory quality. (2) Each word contributes a different level of importance when depicting different image contents, however, unchanged text representation is used in existing image refinement processes. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Network (DM-GAN) to generate high-quality images. The proposed method introduces a dynamic memory module to refine fuzzy image contents, when the initial images are not well generated. A memory writing gate is designed to select the important text information based on the initial image content, which enables our method to accurately generate images from the text description. We also utilize a response gate to adaptively fuse the information read from the memories and the image features. We evaluate the DM-GAN model on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and the Microsoft Common Objects in Context dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our DM-GAN model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DM-GAN:,Dynamic,Memory,Generative,Adversarial,Networks,for,Text-To-Image,Synthesis"
156,Non-Adversarial Image Synthesis With Generative Latent Nearest Neighbors,"Unconditional image generation has recently been dominated by generative adversarial networks (GANs). GAN methods train a generator which regresses images from random noise vectors, as well as a discriminator that attempts to differentiate between the generated images and a training set of real images. GANs have shown amazing results at generating realistic looking images. Despite their success, GANs suffer from critical drawbacks including: unstable training and mode-dropping. The weaknesses in GANs have motivated research into alternatives including: variational auto-encoders (VAEs), latent embedding learning methods (e.g. GLO) and nearest-neighbor based implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE). Unfortunately at the moment, GANs still significantly outperform the alternative methods for image generation. In this work, we present a novel method - Generative Latent Nearest Neighbors (GLANN) - for training generative models without adversarial training. GLANN combines the strengths of IMLE and GLO in a way that overcomes the main drawbacks of each method. Consequently, GLANN generates images that are far better than GLO and IMLE. Our method does not suffer from mode collapse which plagues GAN training and is much more stable. Qualitative results show that GLANN outperforms a baseline consisting of 800 GANs and VAEs on commonly used datasets. Our models are also shown to be effective for training truly non-adversarial unsupervised image translation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Non-Adversarial,Image,Synthesis,With,Generative,Latent,Nearest,Neighbors"

In this paper, we propose a new GAN variant called Mixture Density GAN that overcomes this problem by encouraging the Discriminator to form clusters in its embedding space, which in turn leads the Generator to exploit these and discover different modes in the data. This is achieved by positioning Gaussian density functions in the corners of a simplex, using the resulting Gaussian mixture as a likelihood function over discriminator embeddings, and formulating an objective function for GAN training that is based on these likelihoods. We show how formation of these clusters changes the probability landscape of the discriminator and improves the mode discovery of the GAN. We also show that the optimum of our training objective is attained if and only if the generated and the real distribution match exactly. We support our theoretical results with empirical evaluations on three mode discovery benchmark datasets (Stacked-MNIST, Ring of Gaussians and Grid of Gaussians), and four image datasets (CIFAR-10, CelebA, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST). Furthermore, we demonstrate (1) the ability to avoid mode collapse and discover all the modes and (2) superior quality of the generated images (as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID)), achieving the lowest FID compared to all baselines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mixture,Density,Generative,Adversarial,Networks"

Previous methods often assume that a complete sketch is used as input; however, hand-drawn sketches in common application scenarios are often incomplete, which makes sketch recognition a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose SketchGAN, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) based approach that jointly completes and recognizes a sketch, boosting the performance of both tasks. Specifically, we use a cascade Encode-Decoder network to complete the input sketch in an iterative manner, and employ an auxiliary sketch recognition task to recognize the completed sketch. Experiments on the Sketchy database benchmark demonstrate that our joint learning approach achieves competitive sketch completion and recognition performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

They often produce unsatisfactory results when the holes overlap with or touch foreground objects due to lack of information about the actual extent of foreground and background regions within the holes. These scenarios, however, are very important in practice, especially for applications such as distracting object removal. To address the problem, we propose a foreground-aware image inpainting system that explicitly disentangles structure inference and content completion. Specifically, our model learns to predict the foreground contour first, and then inpaints the missing region using the predicted contour as guidance. We show that by such disentanglement, the contour completion model predicts reasonable contours of objects, and further substantially improves the performance of image inpainting. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves superior inpainting results on challenging cases with complex compositions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Foreground-Aware,Image,Inpainting"

This is partially due to the small amount of annotated artistic data, which is not even comparable to that of natural images captured by cameras. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware architecture which can translate artworks to photo-realistic visualizations, thus reducing the gap between visual features of artistic and realistic data. Our architecture can generate natural images by retrieving and learning details from real photos through a  similarity matching strategy which leverages a weakly-supervised semantic understanding of the scene. Experimental results show that the proposed technique leads to increased realism and to a reduction in domain shift, which improves the performance of pre-trained architectures for classification, detection, and segmentation.

161,Structure-Preserving Stereoscopic View Synthesis With Multi-Scale Adversarial Correlation Matching,"This paper addresses stereoscopic view synthesis from a single image. Various recent works solve this task by reorganizing pixels from the input view to reconstruct the target one in a stereo setup. However, purely depending on such photometric-based reconstruction process, the network may produce structurally inconsistent results.    Regarding this issue, this work proposes Multi-Scale Adversarial Correlation Matching (MS-ACM), a novel learning framework for structure-aware view synthesis. The proposed framework does not assume any costly supervision signal of scene structures such as depth. Instead, it models structures as self-correlation coefficients extracted from multi-scale feature maps in transformed spaces. In training, the feature space attempts to push the correlation distances between the synthesized and target images far apart, thus amplifying inconsistent structures. At the same time, the view synthesis network minimizes such correlation distances by fixing mistakes it makes. With such adversarial training, structural errors of different scales and levels are iteratively discovered and reduced, preserving both global layouts and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that MS-ACM improves both visual quality and the metrics over existing methods when plugged into recent view synthesis architectures.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Structure-Preserving,Stereoscopic,View,Synthesis,With,Multi-Scale,Adversarial,Correlation,Matching"
162,DynTypo: Example-Based Dynamic Text Effects Transfer,"In this paper, we present a novel approach for dynamic text effects transfer by using example-based texture synthesis. In contrast to previous works that require an input video of the target to provide motion guidance, we aim to animate a still image of the target text by transferring the desired dynamic effects from an observed exemplar. Due to the simplicity of target guidance and complexity of realistic effects, it is prone to producing temporal artifacts such as flickers and pulsations. To address the problem, our core idea is to find a common Nearest-neighbor Field (NNF) that would optimize the textural coherence across all keyframes simultaneously. With the static NNF for video sequences, we implicitly transfer motion properties from source to target. We also introduce a guided NNF search by employing the distance-based weight map and Simulated Annealing (SA) for deep direction-guided propagation to allow intense dynamic effects to be completely transferred with no semantic guidance provided. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method in dynamic text effects transfer through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Recent arbitrary style transfer algorithms find it challenging to balance the content structure and the style patterns. Moreover, simultaneously maintaining the global and local style patterns is difficult due to the patch-based mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a novel style-attentional network (SANet) that efficiently and flexibly integrates the local style patterns according to the semantic spatial distribution of the content image. A new identity loss function and multi-level feature embeddings enable our SANet and decoder to preserve the content structure as much as possible while enriching the style patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm synthesizes stylized images in real-time that are higher in quality than those produced by the state-of-the-art algorithms.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Arbitrary,Style,Transfer,With,Style-Attentional,Networks"

In this paper, we present a novel framework to stylize the text with exquisite decor, which is ignored by the previous text stylization methods. Decorative elements pose a challenge to spontaneously handle basal text effects and decor, which are two different styles. To address this issue, our key idea is to learn to separate, transfer and recombine the decors and the basal text effect. A novel text effect transfer network is proposed to infer the styled version of the target text. The stylized text is finally embellished with decor where the placement of the decor is carefully determined by a novel structure-aware strategy. Furthermore, we propose a domain adaptation strategy for decor detection and a one-shot training strategy for text effects transfer, which greatly enhance the robustness of our network to new styles. We base our experiments on our collected topography dataset including 59,000 professionally styled text and demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art style transfer methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Typography,With,Decor:,Intelligent,Text,Style,Transfer"
165,RL-GAN-Net: A Reinforcement Learning Agent Controlled GAN Network for Real-Time Point Cloud Shape Completion,"We present RL-GAN-Net, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent provides fast and robust control of a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our framework is applied to point cloud shape completion that converts noisy, partial point cloud data into a high-fidelity completed shape by controlling the GAN. While a GAN is unstable and hard to train, we circumvent the problem by (1) training the GAN on the latent space representation whose dimension is reduced compared to the raw point cloud input and (2) using an RL agent to find the correct input to the GAN to generate the latent space representation of the shape that best fits the current input of incomplete point cloud. The suggested pipeline robustly completes point cloud with large missing regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train an RL agent to control the GAN, which effectively learns the highly nonlinear mapping from the input noise of the GAN to the latent space of point cloud. The RL agent replaces the need for complex optimization and consequently makes our technique real time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipelines can be used to enhance the classification accuracy of point cloud with missing data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"RL-GAN-Net:,A,Reinforcement,Learning,Agent,Controlled,GAN,Network,for,Real-Time,Point,Cloud,Shape,Completion"

E.g., the character can walk out, run, sit, or jump in 3D. The key contributions of this paper are: 1) an application of viewing and animating humans in single photos in 3D, 2) a novel 2D warping method to deform a posable template body model to fit the person's complex silhouette to create an animatable mesh, and 3) a method for handling partial self occlusions. We compare to state-of-the-art related methods and evaluate results with human studies. Further, we present an interactive interface that allows re-posing the person in 3D, and an augmented reality setup where the animated 3D person can emerge from the photo into the real world.  We demonstrate the method on photos, posters, and art.

167,DeepLight: Learning Illumination for Unconstrained Mobile Mixed Reality,"We present a learning-based method to infer plausible high dynamic range (HDR), omnidirectional illumination given an unconstrained, low dynamic range (LDR) image from a mobile phone camera with a limited field of view (FOV). For training data, we collect videos of various reflective spheres placed within the camera's FOV, leaving most of the background unoccluded, leveraging that materials with diverse reflectance functions reveal different lighting cues in a single exposure. We train a deep neural network to regress from the LDR background image to HDR lighting by matching the LDR ground truth sphere images to those rendered with the predicted illumination using image-based relighting, which is differentiable. Our inference runs at interactive frame rates on a mobile device, enabling realistic rendering of virtual objects into real scenes for mobile mixed reality. Training on automatically exposed and white-balanced videos, we improve the realism of rendered objects compared to the state-of-the art methods for both indoor and outdoor scenes.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DeepLight:,Learning,Illumination,for,Unconstrained,Mobile,Mixed,Reality"
168,Iterative Residual CNNs for Burst Photography Applications,"Modern inexpensive imaging sensors suffer from inherent hardware constraints which often result in captured images of poor quality. Among the most common ways to deal with such limitations is to rely on burst photography, which nowadays acts as the backbone of all modern smartphone imaging applications. In this work, we focus on the fact that every frame of a burst sequence can be accurately described by a forward (physical) model. This, in turn, allows us to restore a single image of higher quality from a sequence of low-quality images as the solution of an optimization problem. Inspired by an extension of the gradient descent method that can handle non-smooth functions, namely the proximal gradient descent, and modern deep learning techniques, we propose a convolutional iterative network with a transparent architecture. Our network uses a burst of low-quality image frames and is able to produce an output of higher image quality recovering fine details which are not distinguishable in any of the original burst frames. We focus both on the burst photography pipeline as a whole, i.e., burst demosaicking and denoising, as well as on the traditional Gaussian denoising task. The developed method demonstrates consistent state-of-the art performance across the two tasks and as opposed to other recent deep learning approaches does not have any inherent restrictions either to the number of frames or their ordering.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Iterative,Residual,CNNs,for,Burst,Photography,Applications"
169,Learning Implicit Fields for Generative Shape Modeling,"We advocate the use of implicit fields for learning generative models of shapes and introduce an implicit field decoder, called IM-NET, for shape generation, aimed at improving the visual quality of the generated shapes. An implicit field assigns a value to each point in 3D space, so that a shape can be extracted as an iso-surface. IM-NET is trained to perform this assignment by means of a binary classifier. Specifically, it takes a point coordinate, along with a feature vector encoding a shape, and outputs a value which indicates whether the point is outside the shape or not. By replacing conventional decoders by our implicit decoder for representation learning (via IM-AE) and shape generation (via IM-GAN), we demonstrate superior results for tasks such as generative shape modeling, interpolation, and single-view 3D reconstruction, particularly in terms of visual quality.

170,Reliable and Efficient Image Cropping: A Grid Anchor Based Approach,"Image cropping aims to improve the composition as well as aesthetic quality of an image by removing extraneous content from it. Existing image cropping databases provide only one or several human-annotated bounding boxes as the groundtruth, which cannot reflect the non-uniqueness and flexibility of image cropping in practice. The employed evaluation metrics such as intersection-over-union cannot reliably reflect the real performance of cropping models, either. This work revisits the problem of image cropping, and presents a grid anchor based formulation by considering the special properties and requirements (e.g., local redundancy, content preservation, aspect ratio) of image cropping. Our formulation reduces the searching space of candidate crops from millions to less than one hundred. Consequently, a grid anchor based cropping benchmark is constructed, where all crops of each image are annotated and more reliable evaluation metrics are defined. We also design an effective and lightweight network module, which simultaneously considers the region of interest and region of discard for more accurate image cropping. Our model can stably output visually pleasing crops for images of different scenes and run at a speed of 125 FPS.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Reliable,and,Efficient,Image,Cropping:,A,Grid,Anchor,Based,Approach"

Inspired by the recent success of neural image super-resolution techniques, we progressively train a cascade of patch-based upsampling networks on different levels of detail end-to-end. We propose a series of architectural design contributions that lead to a substantial performance boost. The effect of each technical contribution is demonstrated in an ablation study. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based and optimazation-based approaches, both in terms of  handling low-resolution inputs and revealing high-fidelity details.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Patch-Based,Progressive,3D,Point,Set,Upsampling"
172,An Iterative and Cooperative Top-Down and Bottom-Up Inference Network for Salient Object Detection,"This paper presents a salient object detection method that integrates both top-down and bottom-up saliency inference in an iterative and cooperative manner. The top-down process is used for coarse-to-fine saliency estimation, where high-level saliency is gradually integrated with finer lower-layer features to obtain a fine-grained result. The bottom-up process infers the high-level, but rough saliency through gradually using upper-layer, semantically-richer features. These two processes are alternatively performed, where the bottom-up process uses the fine-grained saliency obtained from the top-down process to yield enhanced high-level saliency estimate, and the top-down process, in turn, is further benefited from the improved high-level information. The network layers in the bottom-up/top-down processes are equipped with recurrent mechanisms for layer-wise, step-by-step optimization. Thus, saliency information is effectively encouraged to flow in a bottom-up, top-down and intra-layer manner. We show that most other saliency models based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are essentially variants of our model. Extensive experiments on several famous benchmarks clearly demonstrate the superior performance, good generalization, and powerful learning ability of our proposed saliency inference framework.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"An,Iterative,and,Cooperative,Top-Down,and,Bottom-Up,Inference,Network,for,Salient,Object,Detection"
173,Deep Stacked Hierarchical Multi-Patch Network for Image Deblurring,"Despite deep end-to-end learning  methods have shown their superiority in removing non-uniform motion blur, there still exist major challenges with the current multi-scale and scale-recurrent models: 1) Deconvolution/upsampling operations in the coarse-to-fine scheme result in expensive runtime; 2) Simply increasing the model depth with finer-scale levels cannot improve the quality of deblurring. To tackle the above problems, we present a deep  hierarchical multi-patch network  inspired by Spatial Pyramid Matching to deal with blurry images via a fine-to-coarse hierarchical representation. To deal with the performance saturation w.r.t. depth, we propose a stacked version of our multi-patch model. Our proposed basic multi-patch model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the GoPro dataset while enjoying a 40xfaster runtime compared to current multi-scale methods. With 30ms to process an image at 1280x720 resolution, it is the first real-time deep motion deblurring model for 720p images at 30fps. For stacked networks, significant improvements (over 1.2dB) are achieved on the GoPro dataset by increasing the network depth. Moreover, by varying the depth of the stacked model, one can adapt the performance and runtime of the same network for different application scenarios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Stacked,Hierarchical,Multi-Patch,Network,for,Image,Deblurring"

However, the InGaAs sensors commonly used for SWIR imaging suffer from a variety of drawbacks, including high price, low resolution, unstable quality, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for SWIR imaging using a common Silicon sensor, which has cheaper price, higher resolution and better technical maturity compared with the specialized InGaAs sensor. Our key idea is to approximate the response of the InGaAs sensor by exploiting the largely ignored sensitivity of a Silicon sensor, weak as it is, in the SWIR range. To this end, we build a multi-channel optical system to collect a new SWIR dataset and present a physically meaningful three-stage image processing algorithm on the basis of CNN.

Our model is inspired by the recently proposed tensor-tensor product (t-product) based on any invertible linear transforms. When the linear transforms satisfy certain conditions, we deduce the new tensor tubal rank, tensor spectral norm, and tensor nuclear norm. Equipped with the tensor nuclear norm, we then solve the tensor completion problem by solving a convex program and provide the theoretical bound for the exact recovery under certain tensor incoherence conditions. The achieved sampling complexity is order-wise optimal. Our model and result greatly extend existing results in the low-rank matrix and tensor completion. Numerical experiments verify our results and the application on image recovery demonstrates the superiority of our method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Low-Rank,Tensor,Completion,With,a,New,Tensor,Nuclear,Norm,Induced,by,Invertible,Linear,Transforms"

Given labeled source data and big unlabeled target data, we aim to find representatives in the target data, which can not only represent and associate data points belonging to each labeled category, but also discover novel categories in the target data, if any. To leverage labeled source data, we guide representative selection from labeled source to unlabeled target. We propose a joint optimization framework which alternately optimizes (1) representative selection in the target data and (2) discriminative feature learning from both the source and the target for better representative selection. Experiments on image and video datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach not only finds better representatives, but also can discover novel categories in the target data that are not in the source.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Joint,Representative,Selection,and,Feature,Learning:,A,Semi-Supervised,Approach"

This enables our method to improve performance for a wide variety of problems including stereo, depth super-resolution, render from defocus, colorization, and especially high-resolution depth filtering, while keeping the computational complexity linear in the number of pixels. Our method is highly parallelizable and adaptable, and it has demonstrable linear scalability with respect to image resolutions.

178,CapSal: Leveraging Captioning to Boost Semantics for Salient Object Detection,"Detecting salient objects in cluttered scenes is a big challenge. To address this problem, we argue that the model needs to learn discriminative semantic features for salient objects.  To this end, we propose to leverage captioning as an auxiliary semantic task to boost salient object detection in complex scenarios. Specifically, we develop a CapSal model which consists of two sub-networks, the Image Captioning Network (ICN) and the Local-Global Perception Network (LGPN).  ICN encodes the embedding of a generated caption to capture the semantic information of major objects in the scene, while LGPN incorporates the captioning embedding with local-global visual contexts for predicting the saliency map. ICN and LGPN are jointly trained to model high-level semantics as well as visual saliency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of image captioning in boosting the performance of salient object detection. In particular, our model performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods on several challenging datasets of complex scenarios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CapSal:,Leveraging,Captioning,to,Boost,Semantics,for,Salient,Object,Detection"
179,Phase-Only Image Based Kernel Estimation for Single Image Blind Deblurring,"The image motion blurring process is generally modelled as the convolution of a blur kernel with a latent image. Therefore, the estimation of the blur kernel is essentially important for blind image deblurring. Unlike existing approaches which focus on approaching the problem by enforcing various priors on the blur kernel and the latent image, we are aiming at obtaining a high quality blur kernel directly by studying the problem in the frequency domain. We show that the auto-correlation of the absolute phase-only image 1 can provide faithful information about the motion (e.g., the motion direction and magnitude, we call it the motion pattern in this paper.) that caused the blur, leading to a new and efficient blur kernel estimation approach. The blur kernel is then refined and the sharp image is estimated by solving an optimization problem by enforcing a regularization on the blur kernel and the latent image. We further extend our approach to handle non-uniform blur, which involves spatially varying blur kernels. Our approach is evaluated extensively on synthetic and real data and shows good results compared to the state-of-the-art deblurring approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Phase-Only,Image,Based,Kernel,Estimation,for,Single,Image,Blind,Deblurring"

However, the computation of the match density for each pixel may be prohibitively expensive due to the large number of candidates. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Discrete Distribution Decomposition (HD^3), a framework suitable for learning probabilistic pixel correspondences in both optical flow and stereo matching. We decompose the full match density into multiple scales hierarchically, and estimate the local matching distributions at each scale conditioned on the matching and warping at coarser scales. The local distributions can then be composed together to form the global match density. Despite its simplicity, our probabilistic method achieves state-of-the-art results for both optical flow and stereo matching on established benchmarks. We also find the estimated uncertainty is a good indication of the reliability of the predicted correspondences.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hierarchical,Discrete,Distribution,Decomposition,for,Match,Density,Estimation"
181,FOCNet: A Fractional Optimal Control Network for Image Denoising,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been successfully used in many low-level vision problems such as image denoising. Recent studies on the mathematical foundation of DCNN has revealed that the forward propagation of DCNN corresponds to a dynamic system, which can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and solved by the optimal control method. However, most of these methods employ integer-order differential equation, which has local connectivity in time space and cannot describe the long-term memory of the system. Inspired by the fact that the fractional-order differential equation has long-term memory, in this paper we develop an advanced image denoising network, namely FOCNet, by solving a fractional optimal control (FOC) problem. Specifically, the network structure is designed based on the discretization of a fractional-order differential equation, which enjoys long-term memory in both forward and backward passes. Besides, multi-scale feature interactions are introduced into the FOCNet to strengthen the control of the dynamic system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the leading performance of the proposed FOCNet on image denoising.

182,Orthogonal Decomposition Network for Pixel-Wise Binary Classification,"The weight sharing scheme and spatial pooling operations in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) introduce semantic correlation to neighboring pixels on feature maps and therefore deteriorate their pixel-wise classification performance. In this paper, we implement an Orthogonal Decomposition Unit (ODU) that transforms a convolutional feature map into orthogonal bases targeting at de-correlating neighboring pixels on convolutional features. In theory, complete orthogonal decomposition produces orthogonal bases which can perfectly reconstruct any binary mask (ground-truth). In practice, we further design incomplete orthogonal decomposition focusing on de-correlating local patches which balances the reconstruction performance and computational cost. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) implemented with ODUs, referred to as Orthogonal Decomposition Networks (ODNs), learn de-correlated and complementary convolutional features and fuse such features in a pixel-wise selective manner. Over pixel-wise binary classification tasks for two-dimensional image processing, specifically  skeleton detection, edge detection, and saliency detection, and one-dimensional keypoint detection, specifically S-wave arrival time detection for earthquake localization, ODNs consistently improves the state-of-the-arts with significant margins.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Orthogonal,Decomposition,Network,for,Pixel-Wise,Binary,Classification"
183,Multi-Source Weak Supervision for Saliency Detection,"The high cost of pixel-level annotations makes it appealing to train saliency detection models with weak supervision. However, a single weak supervision source usually does not contain enough information to train a well-performing model. To this end, we propose a unified framework to train saliency detection models with diverse weak supervision sources. In this paper, we use category labels, captions, and unlabelled data for training, yet other supervision sources can also be plugged into this flexible framework. We design a classification network (CNet) and a caption generation network (PNet), which learn to predict object categories and generate captions, respectively, meanwhile highlight the most important regions for corresponding tasks. An attention transfer loss is designed to transmit supervision signal between networks, such that the network designed to be trained with one supervision source can benefit from another. An attention coherence loss is defined on unlabelled data to encourage the networks to detect generally salient regions instead of task-specific regions. We use CNet and PNet to generate pixel-level pseudo labels to train a saliency prediction network (SNet). During the testing phases, we only need SNet to predict saliency maps. Experiments demonstrate the performance of our method compares favourably against unsupervised and weakly supervised methods and even some supervised methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Source,Weak,Supervision,for,Saliency,Detection"

Specifically, adding imperceptible perturbations to clean images can fool the well trained deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end image compression model to defend adversarial examples: ComDefend. The proposed model consists of a compression convolutional neural network (ComCNN) and a reconstruction convolutional neural network (ResCNN). The ComCNN is used to maintain the structure information of the original image and purify adversarial perturbations. And the ResCNN is used to reconstruct the original image with high quality. In other words, ComDefend can transform the adversarial image to its clean version, which is then fed to the trained classifier. Our method is a pre-processing module, and does not modify the classifier's structure during the whole process. Therefore it can be combined with other model-specific defense models to jointly improve the classifier's robustness. A series of experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods, and is consistently effective to protect classifiers against adversarial attacks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ComDefend:,An,Efficient,Image,Compression,Model,to,Defend,Adversarial,Examples"

The more advanced ones rely on fast algorithms for upper and lower bounds for the respective cut problems and max-flow techniques for auxiliary min-cut problems.

Unfortunately, PD cannot be directly used in machine learning methods since it is a multiset of points. Recent efforts have been devoted to transforming PDs into vectors to accommodate machine learning methods. However, they share one common shortcoming: the mapping of PDs to a feature representation depends on a pre-defined polynomial. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an algebraic representation for PDs, i.e., polynomial representation. In this work, we discover a set of general polynomials that vanish on vectorized PDs and extract the task-adapted feature representation from these polynomials. We also prove two attractive properties of the proposed polynomial representation, i.e., stability and linear separability.

In this paper, we propose a trellis encoder-decoder network (TEDnet) for crowd counting, which focuses on generating high-quality density estimation maps. The major contributions are four-fold. First, we develop a new trellis architecture that incorporates multiple decoding paths to hierarchically aggregate features at different encoding stages, which improves the representative capability of convolutional features for large variations in objects. Second, we employ dense skip connections interleaved across paths to facilitate sufficient multi-scale feature fusions, which also helps TEDnet to absorb the supervision information. Third, we propose a new combinatorial loss to enforce similarities in local coherence and spatial correlation between maps. By distributedly imposing this combinatorial loss on intermediate outputs, TEDnet can improve the back-propagation process and alleviate the gradient vanishing problem. Finally, on four widely-used benchmarks, our TEDnet achieves the best overall performance in terms of both density map quality and counting accuracy, with an improvement up to 14% in MAE metric. These results validate the effectiveness of TEDnet for crowd counting.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Crowd,Counting,and,Density,Estimation,by,Trellis,Encoder-Decoder,Networks"

The texture map encodes the parameterization from 3D to 2D domain, rendering not only RGB values but also rasterized geometric features if necessary. Since the parameterization of texture map is not pre-determined, and depends on the surface topologies, we therefore introduce a novel cross-atlas convolution to recover the original mesh geodesic neighborhood, so as to achieve the invariance property to arbitrary parameterization. The proposed module is integrated into classification and segmentation architectures, which takes the input texture map of a mesh, and infers the output predictions.

However, as a fundamental scene understanding task, surface normal estimation from RGB-D data lacks thorough investigation. In this paper, a hierarchical fusion network with adaptive feature re-weighting is proposed for surface normal estimation from a single RGB-D image. Specifically, the features from color image and depth are successively integrated at multiple scales to ensure global surface smoothness while preserving visually salient details. Meanwhile, the depth features are re-weighted with a confidence map estimated from depth before merging into the color branch to avoid artifacts caused by input depth corruption. Additionally, a hybrid multi-scale loss function is designed to learn accurate normal estimation given noisy ground-truth dataset. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the fusion strategy and the loss design, outperforming state-of-the-art normal estimation schemes.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Surface,Normal,Estimation,With,Hierarchical,RGB-D,Fusion"

However, since the distribution of real-world relationships is seriously unbalanced, existing methods perform quite poorly for the less frequent relationships. In this work, we find that the statistical correlations between object pairs and their relationships can effectively regularize semantic space and make prediction less ambiguous, and thus well address the unbalanced distribution issue. To achieve this, we incorporate these statistical correlations into deep neural networks to facilitate scene graph generation by developing a Knowledge-Embedded Routing Network. More specifically, we show that the statistical correlations between objects appearing in images and their relationships, can be explicitly represented by a structured knowledge graph, and a routing mechanism is learned to propagate messages through the graph to explore their interactions. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art competitors.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Knowledge-Embedded,Routing,Network,for,Scene,Graph,Generation"

Traditionally, the existing approaches utilize two independent models without sharing features, which makes the pipeline inefficient to implement. In addition, a heuristic method is usually employed to merge the results. However, the overlapping relationship between object instances is difficult to determine without sufficient context information during the merging process. To address the problems, we propose a novel end-to-end Occlusion Aware Network (OANet) for panoptic segmentation, which can efficiently and effectively predict both the instance and stuff segmentation in a single network. Moreover, we introduce a novel spatial ranking module to deal with the occlusion problem between the predicted instances.

195,Marginalized Latent Semantic Encoder for Zero-Shot Learning,"Zero-shot learning has been well explored to precisely identify new unobserved classes through a visual-semantic function obtained from the existing objects. However, there exist two challenging obstacles: one is that the human-annotated semantics are insufficient to fully describe the visual samples; the other is the domain shift across existing and new classes. In this paper, we attempt to exploit the intrinsic relationship in the semantic manifold when given semantics are not enough to describe the visual objects, and enhance the generalization ability of the visual-semantic function with marginalized strategy. Specifically, we design a Marginalized Latent Semantic Encoder (MLSE), which is learned on the augmented seen visual features and the latent semantic representation. Meanwhile, latent semantics are discovered under an adaptive graph reconstruction scheme based on the provided semantics.

196,Scale-Adaptive Neural Dense Features: Learning via Hierarchical Context Aggregation,"How do computers and intelligent agents view the world around them? Feature extraction and representation constitutes one the basic building blocks towards answering this question.  Traditionally, this has been done with carefully engineered hand-crafted techniques such as HOG, SIFT or ORB. However, there is no ""one size fits all"" approach that satisfies all requirements.  In recent years, the rising popularity of deep learning has resulted in a myriad of end-to-end solutions to many computer vision problems.  These approaches, while successful, tend to lack scalability and can't easily exploit information learned by other systems.   Instead, we propose SAND features, a dedicated deep learning solution to feature extraction capable of providing hierarchical context information. This is achieved by employing sparse relative labels indicating relationships or similarity of dissimilarity between image locations. The nature of these labels results in an almost infinite set of dissimilar examples to choose from.  We demonstrate how the selection of negative examples during training can be used to modify the feature space and vary it's learned properties.  To demonstrate the generality of this approach, we apply the proposed features to a multitude of tasks, each requiring different properties.  This includes disparity estimation, semantic segmentation, self-localisation and SLAM. In all cases, we show how incorporating SAND features results in better or comparable results to the baseline, whilst requiring little to no additional training.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Scale-Adaptive,Neural,Dense,Features:,Learning,via,Hierarchical,Context,Aggregation"
197,Unsupervised Embedding Learning via Invariant and Spreading Instance Feature,"This paper studies the unsupervised embedding learning problem, which requires an effective similarity measurement between samples in low-dimensional embedding space. Motivated by the positive concentrated and negative separated properties observed from category-wise supervised learning, we propose to utilize the instance-wise supervision to approximate these properties, which aims at learning data augmentation invariant and instance spread-out features. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel instance based softmax embedding method, which directly optimizes the `real' instance features on top of the softmax function. It achieves significantly faster learning speed and higher accuracy than all existing methods. The proposed method performs well for both seen and unseen testing categories with cosine similarity. It also achieves competitive performance even without pre-trained network over samples from fine-grained categories.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Embedding,Learning,via,Invariant,and,Spreading,Instance,Feature"
198,AOGNets: Compositional Grammatical Architectures for Deep Learning,"Neural architectures are the foundation for improving performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper presents deep compositional grammatical architectures which harness the best of two worlds: grammar models and DNNs. The proposed architectures integrate compositionality and reconfigurability of the former and the capability of learning rich features of the latter in a principled way. We utilize AND-OR Grammar (AOG) as network generator in this paper and call the resulting networks AOGNets. An AOGNet consists of a number of stages each of which is composed of a number of AOG building blocks. An AOG building block splits its input feature map into N groups along feature channels and then treat it as a sentence of N words. It then jointly realizes a phrase structure grammar and a dependency grammar in bottom-up parsing the ""sentence"" for better feature exploration and reuse. It provides a unified framework for the best practices developed in state-of-the-art DNNs. In experiments, AOGNet is tested in the ImageNet-1K classification benchmark and the MS-COCO object detection and segmentation benchmark. In ImageNet-1K, AOGNet obtains better performance than ResNet and most of its variants, ResNeXt and its attention based variants such as SENet, DenseNet and DualPathNet. AOGNet also obtains the best model interpretability score using network dissection. AOGNet further shows better potential in adversarial defense. In MS-COCO, AOGNet obtains better performance than the ResNet and ResNeXt backbones in Mask R-CNN.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"AOGNets:,Compositional,Grammatical,Architectures,for,Deep,Learning"
199,A Robust Local Spectral Descriptor for Matching Non-Rigid Shapes With Incompatible Shape Structures,"Constructing a robust and discriminative local descriptor for 3D shape is a key component of many computer vision applications. Although existing learning-based approaches can achieve good performance in some specific benchmarks, they usually fail to learn enough information from shapes with different shape types and structures (e.g., spatial resolution, connectivity, transformations, etc.)  Focusing on this issue, in this paper, we present a more discriminative local descriptor for deformable 3D shapes with incompatible structures. Based on the spectral embedding using the Laplace-Beltrami framework on the surface, we first construct a novel local spectral feature which shows great resilience to change in mesh resolution, triangulation, transformation. Then the multi-scale local spectral features around each vertex are encoded into a `geometry image', called vertex spectral image, in a very compact way. Such vertex spectral images can be efficiently trained to learn local descriptors using a triplet neural network. Finally, for training and evaluation, we present a new benchmark dataset by extending the widely used FAUST dataset. We utilize a remeshing approach to generate modified shapes with different structures. We evaluate the proposed approach thoroughly and make an extensive comparison to demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on this benchmark.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Robust,Local,Spectral,Descriptor,for,Matching,Non-Rigid,Shapes,With,Incompatible,Shape,Structures"
200,Context and Attribute Grounded Dense Captioning,"Dense captioning aims at simultaneously localizing semantic regions and describing these regions-of-interest (ROIs) with short phrases or sentences in natural language. Previous studies have shown remarkable progresses, but they are often vulnerable to the aperture problem that a caption generated by the features inside one ROI lacks contextual coherence with its surrounding context in the input image. In this work, we investigate contextual reasoning based on multi-scale message propagations from the neighboring contents to the target ROIs. To this end, we design a novel end-to-end context and attribute grounded dense captioning framework consisting of 1) a contextual visual mining module and 2) a multi-level attribute grounded description generation module. Knowing that  captions often co-occur with the linguistic attributes (such as who, what and where), we also incorporate an auxiliary supervision from hierarchical linguistic attributes to augment the distinctiveness of the learned captions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Context,and,Attribute,Grounded,Dense,Captioning"
201,Spot and Learn: A Maximum-Entropy Patch Sampler for Few-Shot Image Classification,"Few-shot learning (FSL) requires one to learn from object categories with a small amount of training data (as novel classes), while the remaining categories (as base classes) contain a sufficient amount of data for training. It is often desirable to transfer knowledge from the base classes and derive dominant features efficiently for the novel samples. In this work, we propose a sampling method that de-correlates an image based on maximum entropy reinforcement learning, and extracts varying sequences of patches on every forward-pass with discriminative information observed. This can be viewed as a form of ""learned"" data augmentation in the sense that we search for different sequences of patches within an image and performs classification with aggregation of the extracted features, resulting in improved FSL performances. In addition, our positive and negative sampling policies along with a newly defined reward function would favorably improve the effectiveness of our model. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our framework and its superiority over recent FSL approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spot,and,Learn:,A,Maximum-Entropy,Patch,Sampler,for,Few-Shot,Image,Classification"
202,Interpreting CNNs via Decision Trees,"This paper aims to quantitatively explain the rationales of each prediction that is made by a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). We propose to learn a decision tree, which clarifies the specific reason for each prediction made by the CNN at the semantic level. I.e., the decision tree decomposes feature representations in high conv-layers of the CNN into elementary concepts of object parts. In this way, the decision tree tells people which object parts activate which filters for the prediction and how much each object part contributes to the prediction score. Such semantic and quantitative explanations for CNN predictions have specific values beyond the traditional pixel-level analysis of CNNs. More specifically, our method mines all potential decision modes of the CNN, where each mode represents a typical case of how the CNN uses object parts for prediction. The decision tree organizes all potential decision modes in a coarse-to-fine manner to explain CNN predictions at different fine-grained levels. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Interpreting,CNNs,via,Decision,Trees"
203,Dense Relational Captioning: Triple-Stream Networks for Relationship-Based Captioning,"Our goal in this work is to train an image captioning model that generates more dense and informative captions. We introduce ""relational captioning,"" a novel image captioning task which aims to generate multiple captions with respect to relational information between objects in an image. Relational captioning is a framework that is advantageous in both diversity and amount of information, leading to image understanding based on relationships. Part-of-speech (POS, i.e. subject-object-predicate categories) tags can be assigned to every English word. We leverage the POS as a prior to guide the correct sequence of words in a caption. To this end, we propose a multi-task triple-stream network (MTTSNet) which consists of three recurrent units for the respective POS and jointly performs POS prediction and captioning. We demonstrate more diverse and richer representations generated by the proposed model against several baselines and competing methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dense,Relational,Captioning:,Triple-Stream,Networks,for,Relationship-Based,Captioning"
204,Deep Modular Co-Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires a fine-grained and simultaneous understanding of both the visual content of images and the textual content of questions. Therefore, designing an effective `co-attention' model to associate key words in questions with key objects in images is central to VQA performance. So far, most successful attempts at co-attention learning have been achieved by using shallow models, and deep co-attention models show little improvement over their shallow counterparts. In this paper, we propose a deep Modular Co-Attention Network (MCAN) that consists of Modular Co-Attention (MCA) layers cascaded in depth. Each MCA layer models the self-attention of questions and images, as well as the question-guided-attention of images jointly using a modular composition of two basic attention units. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MCAN on the benchmark VQA-v2 dataset and conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the reasons behind MCAN's effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that MCAN significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. Our best single model delivers 70.63% overall accuracy on the test-dev set.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Modular,Co-Attention,Networks,for,Visual,Question,Answering"

In this work, we address the problem: environment-aware program generation. Given a visual demonstration or a description of an activity, we generate program sketches representing the essential instructions and propose a model to flesh these into full programs representing the actions needed to perform the activity under the presented environmental constraints. To this end, we build upon VirtualHome, to create a new dataset VirtualHome-Env, where we collect program sketches to represent activities and match programs with environments that can afford them. Furthermore, we construct a knowledge base to sample realistic environments and another knowledge base to seek out the  programs under the sampled environments. Finally, we propose RNN-ResActGraph, a network that generates a program from a given sketch and an environment graph and tracks the changes in the environment induced by the program.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Synthesizing,Environment-Aware,Activities,via,Activity,Sketches"
206,Self-Critical N-Step Training for Image Captioning,"Existing methods for image captioning are usually trained by cross entropy loss, which leads to exposure bias and the inconsistency between the optimizing function and evaluation metrics. Recently it has been shown that these two issues can be addressed by incorporating techniques from reinforcement learning, where one of the popular techniques is the advantage actor-critic algorithm that calculates per-token advantage by estimating state value with a parametrized estimator at the cost of introducing estimation bias. In this paper, we estimate state value without using a parametrized value estimator. With the properties of image captioning, namely, the deterministic state transition function and the sparse reward, state value is equivalent to its preceding state-action value, and we reformulate advantage function by simply replacing the former with the latter. Moreover, the reformulated advantage is extended to n-step, which can generally increase the absolute value of the mean of reformulated advantage while lowering variance. Then two kinds of rollout are adopted to estimate state-action value, which we call self-critical n-step training. Empirically we find that our method can obtain better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods that use the sequence level advantage and parametrized estimator respectively on the widely used MSCOCO benchmark.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Self-Critical,N-Step,Training,for,Image,Captioning"
207,Multi-Target Embodied Question Answering,"Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a relatively new task where an agent is asked to answer questions about its environment from egocentric perception.  EQA as introduced in [8] makes the fundamental assumption that every question, e.g., ""what color is the car?"", has exactly one target (""car"") being inquired about. This assumption puts a direct limitation on the abilities of the agent.  We present a generalization of EQA -- Multi-Target EQA (MT-EQA).  Specifically, we study questions that have multiple targets in them, such as ""Is the dresser in the bedroom bigger than the oven in the kitchen?"", where the agent has to navigate to multiple locations (""dresser in bedroom"", ""oven in kitchen"") and  perform comparative reasoning (""dresser"" bigger than ""oven"") before it can answer a question. Such questions require the development of entirely new modules or components in the agent.  To address this, we propose a modular architecture composed of a program generator, a controller, a navigator, and a VQA module.  The program generator converts the given question into sequential executable sub-programs; the navigator guides the agent to multiple locations pertinent to the navigation-related sub-programs; and the controller learns to select relevant observations along its path. These observations are then fed to the VQA module to predict the answer.  We perform detailed analysis for each of the model components and show that our joint model can outperform previous methods and strong baselines by a significant margin.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Target,Embodied,Question,Answering"
208,Visual Question Answering as Reading Comprehension,"Visual question answering (VQA) demands simultaneous comprehension of both the image visual content and natural language questions. In some cases, the reasoning needs the help of common sense or general knowledge which usually appear in the form of text. Current methods jointly embed both the visual information and the textual feature into the same space. Nevertheless, how to model the complex interactions between the two different modalities is not an easy work. In contrast to struggling on multimodal feature fusion, in this paper, we propose to unify all the input information by natural language so as to convert VQA into a machine reading comprehension problem. With this transformation, our method not only can tackle VQA datasets that focus on observation based questions, but can also be naturally extended to handle knowledge-based VQA which requires to explore large-scale external knowledge base. It is a step towards being able to exploit large volumes of text and natural language processing techniques to address VQA problem. Two types of models are proposed to deal with open-ended VQA and multiple-choice VQA respectively. We evaluate our models on three VQA benchmarks. The comparable performance with the state-of-the-art demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Visual,Question,Answering,as,Reading,Comprehension"
209,StoryGAN: A Sequential Conditional GAN for Story Visualization,"In this work, we propose a new task called Story Visualization. Given a multi-sentence paragraph, the story is visualized by generating a sequence of images, one for each sentence. In contrast to video generation, story visualization focuses less on the continuity in generated images (frames), but more on the global consistency across dynamic scenes and characters -- a challenge that has not been addressed by any single-image or video generation methods. Therefore, we propose a new story-to-image-sequence generation model, StoryGAN, based on the sequential conditional GAN framework. Our model is unique in that it consists of a deep Context Encoder that dynamically tracks the story flow, and two discriminators at the story and image levels, to enhance the image quality and the consistency of the generated sequences. To evaluate the model, we modified existing datasets to create the CLEVR-SV and Pororo-SV datasets.

By introducing a novel ""Feedback Loop"" to connect the network input with output, LidarStereoNet could tackle both noisy Lidar points and misalignment between sensors that have been ignored in existing Lidar-stereo fusion work. Besides, we propose to incorporate the piecewise planar model into the network learning to further constrain depths to conform to the underlying 3D geometry.

211,Versatile Multiple Choice Learning and Its Application to Vision Computing,"Most existing ensemble methods aim to train the underlying embedded models independently and simply aggregate their final outputs via averaging or weighted voting. As many prediction tasks contain uncertainty, most of these ensemble methods just reduce variance of the predictions without considering the collaborations among the ensembles. Different from these ensemble methods, multiple choice learning (MCL) methods exploit the cooperation among all the embedded models to generate multiple diverse hypotheses. In this paper, a new MCL method, called vMCL (the abbreviation of versatile Multiple Choice Learning), is developed to extend the application scenarios of MCL methods by ensembling deep neural networks. Our vMCL method keeps the advantage of existing MCL methods while overcoming their major drawback, thus achieves better performance. The novelty of our vMCL lies in three aspects: (1) a choice network is designed to learn the confidence level of each specialist which can provide the best prediction base on multiple hypotheses; (2) a hinge loss is introduced to alleviate the overconfidence issue in MCL settings; (3) Easy to be implemented and can be trained in an end-to-end manner, which is a very attractive feature for many real-world applications.

212,EV-Gait: Event-Based Robust Gait Recognition Using Dynamic Vision Sensors,"In this paper, we introduce a new type of sensing modality, the Dynamic Vision Sensors (Event Cameras), for the task of gait recognition. Compared with the traditional RGB sensors, the event cameras have many unique advantages such as ultra low resources consumption, high temporal resolution and much larger dynamic range. However, those cameras only produce noisy and asynchronous events of intensity changes rather than frames, where conventional vision-based gait recognition algorithms can't be directly applied. To address this, we propose a new Event-based Gait Recognition (EV-Gait) approach, which exploits motion consistency to effectively remove noise, and uses a deep neural network to recognise gait from the event streams. To evaluate the performance of EV-Gait, we collect two event-based gait datasets, one from real-world experiments and the other by converting the publicly available RGB gait recognition benchmark CASIA-B. Extensive experiments show that EV-Gait can get nearly 96% recognition accuracy in the real-world settings, while on the CASIA-B benchmark it achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art RGB-based gait recognition approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"EV-Gait:,Event-Based,Robust,Gait,Recognition,Using,Dynamic,Vision,Sensors"
213,ToothNet: Automatic Tooth Instance Segmentation and Identification From Cone Beam CT Images,"This paper proposes a method that uses deep convolutional neural networks to achieve automatic and accurate tooth instance segmentation and identification from CBCT (cone beam CT) images for digital dentistry. The core of our method is a two-stage network. In the first stage, an edge map is extracted from the input CBCT image to enhance image contrast along shape boundaries. Then this edge map and the input images are passed to the second stage. In the second stage, we build our network upon the 3D region proposal network (RPN) with a novel learned-similarity matrix to help efficiently remove redundant proposals, speed up training and save GPU memory. To resolve the ambiguity in the identification task, we encode teeth spatial relationships as an additional feature input in the identification task, which helps to remarkably improve the identification accuracy. Our evaluation, comparison and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that our method produces accurate instance segmentation and identification results automatically and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

214,Modularized Textual Grounding for Counterfactual Resilience,"Computer Vision applications often require a textual grounding module with precision, interpretability, and resilience to counterfactual inputs/queries. To achieve high grounding precision, current textual grounding methods heavily rely on large-scale training data with manual annotations at the pixel level. Such annotations are expensive to obtain and thus severely narrow the model's scope of real-world applications. Moreover, most of these methods sacrifice interpretability, generalizability, and they neglect the importance of being resilient to counterfactual inputs. To address these issues, we propose a visual grounding system which is 1) end-to-end trainable in a weakly supervised fashion with only image-level annotations, and 2) counterfactually resilient owing to the modular design. Specifically, we decompose textual descriptions into three levels: entity, semantic attribute,  color information, and perform compositional grounding progressively. We validate our model through a series of experiments and demonstrate its improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our model's performance not only surpasses other weakly/un-supervised methods and even approaches the strongly supervised ones, but also is interpretable for decision making and performs much better in face of counterfactual classes than all the others.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Modularized,Textual,Grounding,for,Counterfactual,Resilience"

Rather than relying on these hand-crafted modules, we innovatively implement the use of various deep neural network structures to establish a learning-based approach. L3-Net learns local descriptors specifically optimized for matching in different real-world driving scenarios. 3D convolutions over a cost volume built in the solution space significantly boosts the localization accuracy. RNNs are demonstrated to be effective in modeling the vehicle's dynamics, yielding better temporal smoothness and accuracy. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of our approach using freshly collected datasets. Multiple trials of repetitive data collection over the same road and areas make our dataset ideal for testing localization systems. The  SunnyvaleBigLoop sequences, with a year's time interval between the collected mapping and testing data, made it quite challenging, but the low localization error of our method in these datasets demonstrates its maturity for real industrial implementation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"L3-Net:,Towards,Learning,Based,LiDAR,Localization,for,Autonomous,Driving"
216,Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks,"The recently introduced panoptic segmentation task has renewed our community's interest in unifying the tasks of instance segmentation (for thing classes) and semantic segmentation (for stuff classes). However, current state-of-the-art methods for this joint task use separate and dissimilar networks for instance and semantic segmentation, without performing any shared computation. In this work, we aim to unify these methods at the architectural level, designing a single network for both tasks. Our approach is to endow Mask R-CNN, a popular instance segmentation method, with a semantic segmentation branch using a shared Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone. Surprisingly, this simple baseline not only remains effective for instance segmentation, but also yields a lightweight, top-performing method for semantic segmentation. In this work, we perform a detailed study of this minimally extended version of Mask R-CNN with FPN, which we refer to as Panoptic FPN, and show it is a robust and accurate baseline for both tasks. Given its effectiveness and conceptual simplicity, we hope our method can serve as a strong baseline and aid future research in panoptic segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Panoptic,Feature,Pyramid,Networks"
217,Mask Scoring R-CNN,"Letting a deep network be aware of the quality of its own predictions is an interesting yet important problem. In the task of instance segmentation, the confidence of instance classification is used as mask quality score in most instance segmentation frameworks. However, the mask quality, quantified as the IoU between the instance mask and its ground truth, is usually not well correlated with classification score. In this paper, we study this problem and propose Mask Scoring R-CNN which contains a network block to learn the quality of the predicted instance masks. The proposed network block takes the instance feature and the corresponding predicted mask together to regress the mask IoU. The mask scoring strategy calibrates the misalignment between mask quality and mask score, and improves instance segmentation performance by prioritizing more accurate mask predictions during COCO AP evaluation. By extensive evaluations on the COCO dataset, Mask Scoring R-CNN brings consistent and noticeable gain with different models and outperforms the state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN. We hope our simple and effective approach will provide a new direction for improving instance segmentation.

218,Reasoning-RCNN: Unifying Adaptive Global Reasoning Into Large-Scale Object Detection,"In this paper, we address the large-scale object detection problem with thousands of categories, which poses severe challenges due to long-tail data distributions, heavy occlusions, and class ambiguities. However, the dominant object detection paradigm is limited by treating each object region separately without considering crucial semantic dependencies among objects. In this work, we introduce a novel Reasoning-RCNN to endow any detection networks the capability of adaptive global reasoning over all object regions by exploiting diverse human commonsense knowledge. Instead of only propagating the visual features on the image directly, we evolve the high-level semantic representations of all categories globally to avoid distracted or poor visual features in the image. Specifically, built on feature representations of basic detection network, the proposed network first generates a global semantic pool by collecting the weights of previous classification layer for each category, and then adaptively enhances each object features via attending different semantic contexts in the global semantic pool. Rather than propagating information from all semantic information that may be noisy, our adaptive global reasoning automatically discovers most relative categories for feature evolving. Our Reasoning-RCNN is light-weight and flexible enough to enhance any detection backbone networks, and extensible for integrating any knowledge resources. Solid experiments on object detection benchmarks show the superiority of our Reasoning-RCNN, e.g. achieving around 16% improvement on VisualGenome, 37% on ADE in terms of mAP and 15% improvement on COCO.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Reasoning-RCNN:,Unifying,Adaptive,Global,Reasoning,Into,Large-Scale,Object,Detection"
219,Cross-Modality Personalization for Retrieval,"Existing captioning and gaze prediction approaches do not consider the multiple facets of personality that affect how a viewer extracts meaning from an image. While there are methods that consider personalized captioning, they do not consider personalized perception across modalities, i.e. how a person's way of looking at an image (gaze) affects the way they describe it (captioning). In this work, we propose a model for modeling cross-modality personalized retrieval. In addition to modeling gaze and captions, we also explicitly model the personality of the users providing these samples. We incorporate constraints that encourage gaze and caption samples on the same image to be close in a learned space; we refer to this as content modeling. We also model style: we encourage samples provided by the same user to be close in a separate embedding space, regardless of the image on which they were provided. To leverage the complementary information that content and style constraints provide, we combine the embeddings from both networks. We show that our combined embeddings achieve better performance than existing approaches for cross-modal retrieval.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cross-Modality,Personalization,for,Retrieval"

The encoding function of the image text query learns a representation, such that the similarity with the target image representation is high iff it is a ""positive match"".

221,Arbitrary Shape Scene Text Detection With Adaptive Text Region Representation,"Scene text detection attracts much attention in computer vision, because it can be widely used in many applications such as real-time text translation, automatic information entry, blind person assistance, robot sensing and so on. Though many methods have been proposed for horizontal and oriented texts, detecting irregular shape texts such as curved texts is still a challenging problem. To solve the problem, we propose a robust scene text detection method with adaptive text region representation. Given an input image, a text region proposal network is first used for extracting text proposals. Then, these proposals are verified and refined with a refinement network. Here, recurrent neural network based adaptive text region representation is proposed for text region refinement, where a pair of boundary points are predicted each time step until no new points are found. In this way, text regions of arbitrary shapes are detected and represented with adaptive number of boundary points. This gives more accurate description of text regions. Experimental results on five benchmarks, namely, CTW1500, TotalText, ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015 and MSRA-TD500, show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art in scene text detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Arbitrary,Shape,Scene,Text,Detection,With,Adaptive,Text,Region,Representation"

Despite their significant improvements, the regression-based methods are incapable of providing the detection of individuals in crowds. The detection-based methods, on the other hand, have not been largely explored in recent trends of crowd counting due to the needs for expensive bounding box annotations. In this work, we instead propose a new deep detection network with only point supervision required. It can simultaneously detect the size and location of human heads and count them in crowds. We first mine useful person size information from point-level annotations and initialize the pseudo ground truth bounding boxes. An online updating scheme is introduced to refine the pseudo ground truth during training; while a locally-constrained regression loss is designed to provide additional constraints on the size of the predicted boxes in a local neighborhood. In the end, we propose a curriculum learning strategy to train the network from images of relatively accurate and easy pseudo ground truth first. Extensive experiments are conducted in both detection and counting tasks on several standard benchmarks, e.g. ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, WiderFace, and TRANCOS datasets, and the results show the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Point,in,,Box,Out:,Beyond,Counting,Persons,in,Crowds"
224,Locating Objects Without Bounding Boxes,"Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved remarkable results in locating objects in images. In these networks, the training procedure usually requires providing bounding boxes or the maximum number of expected objects. In this paper, we address the task of estimating object locations without annotated bounding boxes which are typically hand-drawn and time consuming to label. We propose a loss function that can be used in any fully convolutional network (FCN) to estimate object locations. This loss function is a modification of the average Hausdorff distance between two unordered sets of points. The proposed method has no notion of bounding boxes, region proposals, or sliding windows. We evaluate our method with three datasets designed to locate people's heads, pupil centers and plant centers. We outperform state-of-the-art generic object detectors and methods fine-tuned for pupil tracking.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Locating,Objects,Without,Bounding,Boxes"
225,FineGAN: Unsupervised Hierarchical Disentanglement for Fine-Grained Object Generation and Discovery,"We propose FineGAN, a novel unsupervised GAN framework, which disentangles the background, object shape, and object appearance to hierarchically generate images of fine-grained object categories. To disentangle the factors without supervision, our key idea is to use information theory to associate each factor to a latent code, and to condition the relationships between the codes in a specific way to induce the desired hierarchy. Through extensive experiments, we show that FineGAN achieves the desired disentanglement to generate realistic and diverse images belonging to fine-grained classes of birds, dogs, and cars.  Using FineGAN's automatically learned features, we also cluster real images as a first attempt at solving the novel problem of unsupervised fine-grained object category discovery.

226,Mutual Learning of Complementary Networks via Residual Correction for Improving Semi-Supervised Classification,"Deep mutual learning jointly trains multiple essential networks having similar properties to improve semi-supervised classification. However, the commonly used consistency regularization between the outputs of the networks may not fully leverage the difference between them. In this paper, we explore how to capture the complementary information to enhance mutual learning. For this purpose, we propose a complementary correction network (CCN), built on top of the essential networks, to learn the mapping from the output of one essential network to the ground truth label, conditioned on the features learnt by another. To make the second essential network increasingly complementary to the first one, this network is supervised by the corrected predictions. As a result, minimizing the prediction divergence between the two complementary networks can lead to significant performance gains in semi-supervised learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly improves mutual learning between essential networks, and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple semi-supervised classification benchmarks. In particular, the test error rates are reduced from previous 21.23% and 14.65% to 12.05% and 10.37% on CIFAR-10 with 1000 and 2000 labels, respectively.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mutual,Learning,of,Complementary,Networks,via,Residual,Correction,for,Improving,Semi-Supervised,Classification"
227,Sampling Techniques for Large-Scale Object Detection From Sparsely Annotated Objects,"Efficient and reliable methods for training of object detectors are in higher demand than ever, and more and more data relevant to the field is becoming available. However, large datasets like Open Images Dataset v4 (OID) are sparsely annotated, and some measure must be taken in order to ensure the training of a reliable detector. In order to take the incompleteness of these datasets into account, one possibility is to use pretrained models to detect the presence of the unverified objects. However, the performance of such a strategy depends largely on the power of the pretrained model. In this study, we propose part-aware sampling, a method that uses human intuition for the hierarchical relation between objects. In terse terms, our method works by making assumptions like ""a bounding box for a car should contain a bounding box for a tire"". We demonstrate the power of our method on OID and compare the performance against a method based on a pretrained model. Our method also won the first and second place on the public and private test sets of the Google AI Open Images Competition 2018.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Sampling,Techniques,for,Large-Scale,Object,Detection,From,Sparsely,Annotated,Objects"
228,Curls & Whey: Boosting Black-Box Adversarial Attacks,"Image classifiers based on deep neural networks suffer from harassment caused by adversarial examples. Two defects exist in black-box iterative attacks that generate adversarial examples by incrementally adjusting the noise-adding direction for each step. On the one hand, existing iterative attacks add noises monotonically along the direction of gradient ascent, resulting in a lack of diversity and adaptability of the generated iterative trajectories. On the other hand, it is trivial to perform adversarial attack by adding excessive noises, but currently there is no refinement mechanism to squeeze redundant noises. In this work, we propose Curls & Whey black-box attack to fix the above two defects. During Curls iteration, by combining gradient ascent and descent, we `curl' up iterative trajectories to integrate more diversity and transferability into adversarial examples. Curls iteration also alleviates the diminishing marginal effect in existing iterative attacks. The Whey optimization further squeezes the `whey' of noises by exploiting the robustness of adversarial perturbation. Extensive experiments on Imagenet and Tiny-Imagenet demonstrate that our approach achieves impressive decrease on noise magnitude in l2 norm. Curls & Whey attack also shows promising transferability against ensemble models as well as adversarially trained models. In addition, we extend our attack to the targeted misclassification, effectively reducing the difficulty of targeted attacks under black-box condition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Curls,&,Whey:,Boosting,Black-Box,Adversarial,Attacks"
229,Barrage of Random Transforms for Adversarially Robust Defense,"Defenses against adversarial examples, when using the ImageNet dataset, are historically easy to defeat. The common understanding is that a combination of simple image transformations and other various defenses are insufficient to provide the necessary protection when the obfuscated gradient is taken into account. In this paper, we explore the idea of stochastically combining a large number of individually weak defenses into a single barrage of randomized transformations to build a strong defense against adversarial attacks. We show that, even after accounting for obfuscated gradients, the Barrage of Random Transforms (BaRT) is a resilient defense against even the most difficult attacks, such as PGD. BaRT achieves up to a 24x improvement in accuracy compared to previous work, and has even extended effectiveness out to a previously untested maximum adversarial perturbation of e=32.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Barrage,of,Random,Transforms,for,Adversarially,Robust,Defense"
230,Aggregation Cross-Entropy for Sequence Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a novel method, aggregation cross-entropy (ACE), for sequence recognition from a brand new perspective. The ACE loss function exhibits competitive performance to CTC and the attention mechanism, with much quicker implementation (as it involves only four fundamental formulas), faster inference\back-propagation (approximately O(1) in parallel), less storage requirement (no parameter and negligible runtime memory), and convenient employment (by replacing CTC with ACE). Furthermore, the proposed ACE loss function exhibits two noteworthy properties: (1) it can be directly applied for 2D prediction by flattening the 2D prediction into 1D prediction as the input and (2) it requires only characters and their numbers in the sequence annotation for supervision, which allows it to advance beyond sequence recognition, e.g., counting problem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/summerlvsong/Aggregation-Cross-Entropy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Aggregation,Cross-Entropy,for,Sequence,Recognition"
231,LaSO: Label-Set Operations Networks for Multi-Label Few-Shot Learning,"Example synthesis is one of the leading methods to tackle the problem of few-shot learning, where only a small number of samples per class are available. However, current synthesis approaches only address the scenario of a single category label per image. In this work, we propose a novel technique for synthesizing samples with multiple labels for the (yet unhandled) multi-label few-shot classification scenario. We propose to combine pairs of given examples in feature space, so that the resulting synthesized feature vectors will correspond to examples whose label sets are obtained through certain set operations on the label sets of the corresponding input pairs. Thus, our method is capable of producing a sample containing the intersection, union or set-difference of labels present in two input samples. As we show, these set operations generalize to labels unseen during training. This enables performing augmentation on examples of novel categories, thus, facilitating multi-label few-shot classifier learning. We conduct numerous experiments showing promising results for the label-set manipulation capabilities of the proposed approach, both directly (using the classification and retrieval metrics), and in the context of performing data augmentation for multi-label few-shot learning. We propose a benchmark for this new and challenging task and show that our method compares favorably to all the common baselines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LaSO:,Label-Set,Operations,Networks,for,Multi-Label,Few-Shot,Learning"
232,Few-Shot Learning With Localization in Realistic Settings,"Traditional recognition methods typically require large, artificially-balanced training classes, while few-shot learning methods are tested on artificially small ones. In contrast to both extremes, real world recognition problems exhibit heavy-tailed class distributions, with cluttered scenes and a mix of coarse and fine-grained class distinctions. We show that prior methods designed for few-shot learning do not work out of the box in these challenging conditions, based on a new ""meta-iNat"" benchmark. We introduce three parameter-free improvements: (a) better training procedures based on adapting cross-validation to meta-learning, (b) novel architectures that localize objects using limited bounding box annotations before classification, and (c) simple parameter-free expansions of the feature space based on bilinear pooling. Together, these improvements double the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on meta-iNat while generalizing to prior benchmarks, complex neural architectures, and settings with substantial domain shift.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Few-Shot,Learning,With,Localization,in,Realistic,Settings"
233,AdaGraph: Unifying Predictive and Continuous Domain Adaptation Through Graphs,"The ability to categorize is a cornerstone of visual intelligence, and a key functionality for artificial, autonomous visual machines. This problem will never be solved without algorithms able to adapt and generalize across visual domains. Within the context of domain adaptation and generalization, this paper focuses on the predictive domain adaptation scenario, namely the case where no target data are available and the system has to learn to generalize from annotated source images plus unlabeled samples with associated metadata from auxiliary domains. Our contribution is the first deep architecture that tackles predictive domain adaptation, able to leverage over the information brought by the auxiliary domains through a graph. Moreover, we present a simple yet effective strategy that allows us to take advantage of the incoming target data at test time, in a continuous domain adaptation scenario. Experiments on three benchmark databases support the value of our approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"AdaGraph:,Unifying,Predictive,and,Continuous,Domain,Adaptation,Through,Graphs"
234,Grounded Video Description,"Video description is one of the most challenging problems in vision and language understanding due to the large variability both on the video and language side. Models, hence, typically shortcut the difficulty in recognition and generate plausible sentences that are based on priors but are not necessarily grounded in the video. In this work, we explicitly link the sentence to the evidence in the video by annotating each noun phrase in a sentence with the corresponding bounding box in one of the frames of a video. Our dataset, ActivityNet-Entities, augments the challenging ActivityNet Captions dataset with 158k bounding box annotations, each grounding a noun phrase. This allows training video description models with this data, and importantly, evaluate how grounded or ""true"" such model are to the video they describe. To generate grounded captions, we propose a novel video description model which is able to exploit these bounding box annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on our dataset, but also show how it can be applied to image description on the Flickr30k Entities dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on video description, video paragraph description, and image description and demonstrate our generated sentences are better grounded in the video.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Grounded,Video,Description"
235,Streamlined Dense Video Captioning,"Dense video captioning is an extremely challenging task since accurate and coherent description of events in a video requires holistic understanding of video contents as well as contextual reasoning of individual events. Most existing approaches handle this problem by first detecting event proposals from a video and then captioning on a subset of the proposals. As a result, the generated sentences are prone to be redundant or inconsistent since they fail to consider temporal dependency between events. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel dense video captioning framework, which models temporal dependency across events in a video explicitly and leverages visual and linguistic context from prior events for coherent storytelling. This objective is achieved by 1) integrating an event sequence generation network to select a sequence of event proposals adaptively, and 2) feeding the sequence of event proposals to our sequential video captioning network, which is trained by reinforcement learning with two-level rewards---at both event and episode levels---for better context modeling. The proposed technique achieves outstanding performances on ActivityNet Captions dataset in most metrics.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Streamlined,Dense,Video,Captioning"
236,Adversarial Inference for Multi-Sentence Video Description,"While significant progress has been made in the image captioning task, video description is still in its infancy due to the complex nature of video data. Generating multi-sentence descriptions for long videos is even more challenging. Among the main issues are the fluency and coherence of the generated descriptions, and their relevance to the video. Recently, reinforcement and adversarial learning based methods have been explored to improve the image captioning models; however, both types of methods suffer from a number of issues, e.g. poor readability and high redundancy for RL and stability issues for GANs. In this work, we instead propose to apply adversarial techniques during inference, designing a discriminator which encourages better multi-sentence video description. In addition, we find that a multi-discriminator ""hybrid"" design, where each discriminator targets one aspect of a description, leads to the best results. Specifically, we decouple the discriminator to evaluate on three criteria: 1) visual relevance to the video, 2) language diversity and fluency, and 3) coherence across sentences. Our approach results in more accurate, diverse, and coherent multi-sentence video descriptions, as shown by automatic as well as human evaluation on the popular ActivityNet Captions dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Adversarial,Inference,for,Multi-Sentence,Video,Description"
237,Unified Visual-Semantic Embeddings: Bridging Vision and Language With Structured Meaning Representations,"We propose the Unified Visual-Semantic Embeddings (Unified VSE) for learning a joint space of visual representation and textual semantics. The model unifies the embeddings of concepts at different levels: objects, attributes, relations, and full scenes. We view the sentential semantics as a combination of different semantic components such as objects and relations; their embeddings are aligned with different image regions. A contrastive learning approach is proposed for the effective learning of this fine-grained alignment from only image-caption pairs. We also present a simple yet effective approach that enforces the coverage of caption embeddings on the semantic components that appear in the sentence. We demonstrate that the Unified VSE outperforms baselines on cross-modal retrieval tasks; the enforcement of the semantic coverage improves the model's robustness in defending text-domain adversarial attacks. Moreover, our model empowers the use of visual cues to accurately resolve word dependencies in novel sentences.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unified,Visual-Semantic,Embeddings:,Bridging,Vision,and,Language,With,Structured,Meaning,Representations"
238,Learning to Compose Dynamic Tree Structures for Visual Contexts,"We propose to compose dynamic tree structures that place the objects in an image into a visual context, helping visual reasoning tasks such as scene graph generation and visual Q&A. Our visual context tree model, dubbed VCTree, has two key advantages over existing structured object representations including chains and fully-connected graphs: 1) The efficient and expressive binary tree encodes the inherent parallel/hierarchical relationships among objects, e.g., ""clothes"" and ""pants"" are usually co-occur and belong to ""person""; 2) the dynamic structure varies from image to image and task to task, allowing more content-/task-specific message passing among objects. To construct a VCTree, we design a score function that calculates the task-dependent validity between each object pair, and the tree is the binary version of the maximum spanning tree from the score matrix. Then, visual contexts are encoded by bidirectional TreeLSTM and decoded by task-specific models. We develop a hybrid learning procedure which integrates end-task supervised learning and the tree structure reinforcement learning, where the former's evaluation result serves as a self-critic for the latter's structure exploration.  Experimental results on two benchmarks, which require reasoning over contexts: Visual Genome for scene graph generation and VQA2.0 for visual Q&A, show that VCTree outperforms state-of-the-art results while discovering interpretable visual context structures.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Compose,Dynamic,Tree,Structures,for,Visual,Contexts"
239,Reinforced Cross-Modal Matching and Self-Supervised Imitation Learning for Vision-Language Navigation,"Vision-language navigation (VLN) is the task of navigating an embodied agent to carry out natural language instructions inside real 3D environments. In this paper, we study how to address three critical challenges for this task: the cross-modal grounding, the ill-posed feedback, and the generalization problems.  First, we propose a novel Reinforced Cross-Modal Matching (RCM) approach that enforces cross-modal grounding both locally and globally via reinforcement learning (RL). Particularly,  a matching critic is used to provide an intrinsic reward to encourage global matching between instructions and trajectories, and a reasoning navigator is employed to perform cross-modal grounding in the local visual scene.  Evaluation on a VLN benchmark dataset shows that our RCM model significantly outperforms previous methods by 10% on SPL and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.  To improve the generalizability of the learned policy, we further introduce a Self-Supervised Imitation Learning (SIL) method to explore unseen environments by imitating its own past, good decisions. We demonstrate that SIL can approximate a better and more efficient policy, which tremendously minimizes the success rate performance gap between seen and unseen environments (from 30.7% to 11.7%).",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Reinforced,Cross-Modal,Matching,and,Self-Supervised,Imitation,Learning,for,Vision-Language,Navigation"

We propose a novel method of dynamically fuse multi-modal features with intra- and inter-modality information flow, which alternatively pass dynamic information between and across the visual and language modalities. It can robustly capture the high-level interactions  between language and vision domains, thus significantly improves the performance of visual question answering. We also show that, the proposed dynamic intra modality attention flow conditioned on the other modality can dynamically modulate the intra-modality attention of the current modality, which is vital for multimodality feature fusion. Experimental evaluations on the VQA 2.0 dataset show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art VQA performance. Extensive  ablation studies are carried out for the comprehensive analysis of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dynamic,Fusion,With,Intra-,and,Inter-Modality,Attention,Flow,for,Visual,Question,Answering"
241,Cycle-Consistency for Robust Visual Question Answering,"Despite significant progress in Visual Question Answer-ing over the years, robustness of today's VQA models leave much to be desired.  We introduce a new evaluation protocol and associated dataset  (VQA-Rephrasings)  and show that state-of-the-art  VQA models  are notoriously brittle to  linguistic variations in questions. VQA-Rephrasings contains 3 human-provided rephrasings for 40k questions-image pairs from the VQA  v2.0 validation dataset.  As a step towards improving robustness of VQA models, we propose a model-agnostic framework that exploits cycle consistency.  Specifically, we train a model to not only answer a question, but also generate a question conditioned on the answer,  such that the  answer predicted for the generated question is the same as the ground truth answer to the original question. Without the use of additional supervision, we show that our approach is significantly more robust to linguistic variations than state-of-the-art VQA models, when evaluated on the  VQA-Rephrasings dataset.   In   addition, our approach also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the standard VQA and Visual Question Generation tasks on the challenging VQA v2.0 dataset.

We thoroughly study navigation policies that utilize  3D point clouds, RGB images, or their combination. Our analysis of these models reveals several key findings. We find that two seemingly naive navigation baselines, forward-only and random, are strong navigators and challenging to outperform, due to the specific choice of the evaluation setting presented by [1].  We find a novel loss-weighting scheme we call Inflection Weighting to be important when training recurrent models for navigation with behavior cloning and are able to out perform the baselines with this technique. We find that point clouds provide a richer signal than RGB images for learning obstacle avoidance, motivating the use (and continued study) of 3D deep learning models for  embodied navigation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Embodied,Question,Answering,in,Photorealistic,Environments,With,Point,Cloud,Perception"

To obtain a reasonable answer based on the current question and the dialog history, the underlying semantic dependencies between dialog entities are essential. In this paper, we explicitly formalize this task as inference in a graphical model with partially observed nodes and unknown graph structures (relations in dialog). The given dialog entities are viewed as the observed nodes. The answer to a given question is represented by a node with missing value. We first introduce an Expectation Maximization algorithm to infer both the underlying dialog structures and the missing node values (desired answers). Based on this, we proceed to propose a differentiable graph neural network (GNN) solution that approximates this process.  Experiment results on the VisDial and VisDial-Q datasets show that our model outperforms comparative methods. It is also observed that our method can infer the underlying dialog structure for better dialog reasoning.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Reasoning,Visual,Dialogs,With,Structural,and,Partial,Observations"
244,Recursive Visual Attention in Visual Dialog,"Visual dialog is a challenging vision-language task, which requires the agent to answer multi-round questions about an image. It typically needs to address two major problems: (1) How to answer visually-grounded questions, which is the core challenge in visual question answering (VQA); (2) How to infer the co-reference between questions and the dialog history. An example of visual co-reference is: pronouns (e.g., ""they"") in the question (e.g., ""Are they on or off?"") are linked with nouns (e.g., ""lamps"") appearing in the dialog history (e.g., ""How many lamps are there?"") and the object grounded in the image. In this work, to resolve the visual co-reference for visual dialog, we propose a novel attention mechanism called Recursive Visual Attention (RvA). Specifically, our dialog agent browses the dialog history until the agent has sufficient confidence in the visual co-reference resolution, and refines the visual attention recursively. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the large-scale VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate that the proposed RvA not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, but also achieves reasonable recursion and interpretable attention maps without additional annotations.

245,Two Body Problem: Collaborative Visual Task Completion,"Collaboration is a necessary skill to perform tasks that are beyond one agent's capabilities. Addressed extensively in both conventional and modern AI, multi-agent collaboration has often been studied in the context of simple grid worlds. We argue that there are inherently visual aspects to collaboration which should be studied in visually rich environments. A key element in collaboration is communication that can be either explicit, through messages, or implicit, through perception of the other agents and the visual world. Learning to collaborate in a visual environment entails learning (1) to perform the task, (2) when and what to communicate, and (3) how to act based on these communications and the perception of the visual world. In this paper we study the problem of learning to collaborate directly from pixels in AI2-THOR and demonstrate the benefits of explicit and implicit modes of communication to perform visual tasks.

We have developed a strong and robust question engine that leverages Visual Genome scene graph structures to create 22M diverse reasoning questions, which all come with functional programs that represent their semantics. We use the programs to gain tight control over the answer distribution and present a new tunable smoothing technique to mitigate question biases. Accompanying the dataset is a suite of new metrics that evaluate essential qualities such as consistency, grounding and plausibility. A careful analysis is performed for baselines as well as state-of-the-art models, providing fine-grained results for different question types and topologies. Whereas a blind LSTM obtains a mere 42.1%, and strong VQA models achieve 54.1%, human performance tops at 89.3%, offering ample opportunity for new research to explore.

Unlike recent works, our method does NOT use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Text2Scene instead learns to sequentially generate objects and their attributes (location, size, appearance, etc) at every time step by attending to different parts of the input text and the current status of the generated scene. We show that under minor modifications, the proposed framework can handle the generation of different forms of scene representations, including cartoon-like scenes, object layouts corresponding to real images, and synthetic images. Our method is not only competitive when compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based methods using automatic metrics and superior based on human judgments but also has the advantage of producing interpretable results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Text2Scene:,Generating,Compositional,Scenes,From,Textual,Descriptions"
248,From Recognition to Cognition: Visual Commonsense Reasoning,"Visual understanding goes well beyond object recognition. With one glance at an image, we can effortlessly imagine the world beyond the pixels: for instance, we can infer people's actions, goals, and mental states. While this task is easy for humans, it is tremendously difficult for today's vision systems, requiring higher-order cognition and commonsense reasoning about the world. We formalize this task as Visual Commonsense Reasoning. Given a challenging question about an image, a machine must answer correctly and then provide a rationale justifying its answer.  Next, we introduce a new dataset, VCR, consisting of 290k multiple choice QA problems derived from 110k movie scenes. The key recipe for generating non-trivial and high-quality problems at scale is Adversarial Matching, a new approach to transform rich annotations into multiple choice questions with minimal bias. Experimental results show that while humans find VCR easy (over 90% accuracy), state-of-the-art vision models struggle ( 45%).  To move towards cognition-level understanding, we present a new reasoning engine, Recognition to Cognition Networks (R2C), that models the necessary layered inferences for grounding, contextualization, and reasoning. R2C helps narrow the gap between humans and machines ( 65%); still, the challenge is far from solved, and we provide analysis that suggests avenues for future work.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"From,Recognition,to,Cognition:,Visual,Commonsense,Reasoning"
249,The Regretful Agent: Heuristic-Aided Navigation Through Progress Estimation,"As deep learning continues to make progress for challenging perception tasks, there is increased interest in combining vision, language, and decision-making. Specifically, the Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) task involves navigating to a goal purely from language instructions and visual information without explicit knowledge of the goal. Recent successful approaches have made in-roads in achieving good success rates for this task but rely on beam search, which thoroughly explores a large number of trajectories and is unrealistic for applications such as robotics. In this paper, inspired by the intuition of viewing the problem as search on a navigation graph, we propose to use a progress monitor developed in prior work as a learnable heuristic for search. We then propose two modules incorporated into an end-to-end architecture: 1) A learned mechanism to perform backtracking, which decides whether to continue moving forward or roll back to a previous state (Regret Module) and 2) A mechanism to help the agent decide which direction to go next by showing directions that are visited and their associated progress estimate (Progress Marker). Combined, the proposed approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods using greedy action selection, with 5% absolute improvement on the test server in success rates, and more importantly 8% on success rates normalized by the path length.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"The,Regretful,Agent:,Heuristic-Aided,Navigation,Through,Progress,Estimation"

Given a natural language instruction and photo-realistic image views of a previously unseen environment, the agent was tasked with navigating from source to target location as quickly as possible. While all current approaches make local action decisions or score entire trajectories using beam search, ours balances local and global signals when exploring an unobserved environment. Importantly, this lets us act greedily but use global signals to backtrack when necessary.

251,Learning to Learn How to Learn: Self-Adaptive Visual Navigation Using Meta-Learning,"Learning is an inherently continuous phenomenon. When humans learn a new task there is no explicit distinction between training and inference. As we learn a task, we keep learning about it while performing the task. What we learn and how we learn it varies during different stages of learning. Learning how to learn and adapt is a key property that enables us to generalize effortlessly to new settings. This is in contrast with conventional settings in machine learning where a trained model is frozen during inference. In this paper we study the problem of learning to learn at both training and test time in the context of visual navigation. A fundamental challenge in navigation is generalization to unseen scenes.  In this paper we propose a self-adaptive visual navigation method (SAVN) which learns to adapt to new environments without any explicit supervision. Our solution is a meta-reinforcement learning approach where an agent learns a self-supervised interaction loss that encourages effective navigation. Our experiments, performed in the AI2-THOR framework, show major improvements in both success rate and SPL for visual navigation in novel scenes.

252,High Flux Passive Imaging With Single-Photon Sensors,"Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerging technology with a unique capability of capturing individual photons with high timing precision. SPADs are being used in several active imaging systems (e.g., fluorescence lifetime microscopy and LiDAR), albeit mostly limited to low photon flux settings. We propose passive free-running SPAD (PF-SPAD) imaging, an imaging modality that uses SPADs for capturing 2D intensity images with unprecedented dynamic range under ambient lighting, without any active light source. Our key observation is thatthe precise inter-photon timing measured by a SPAD can be used for estimating scene brightness under ambient lighting conditions, even for very bright scenes. We develop a theoretical model for PF-SPAD imaging, and derive a scene brightness estimator based on the average time of darkness between successive photons detected by a PF-SPAD pixel. Our key insight is that due to the stochastic nature of photon arrivals, this estimator does not suffer from a hard saturation limit. Coupled with high sensitivity at low flux, this enables a PF-SPAD pixel to measure a wide range of scene brightnesses, from very low to very high, thereby achieving extreme dynamic range. We demonstrate an improvement of over 2 orders of magnitude over conventional sensors by imaging scenes spanning a dynamic range of 10^6:1.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"High,Flux,Passive,Imaging,With,Single-Photon,Sensors"
253,Photon-Flooded Single-Photon 3D Cameras,"Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are starting to play a pivotal role in the development of photon-efficient, long-range LiDAR systems. However, due to non-linearities in their image formation model, a high photon flux (e.g., due to strong sunlight) leads to distortion of the incident temporal waveform, and potentially, large depth errors. Operating SPADs in low flux regimes can mitigate these distortions, but, often requires attenuating the signal and thus, results in low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we address the following basic question: what is the optimal photon flux that a SPAD-based LiDAR should be operated in? We derive a closed form expression for the optimal flux, which is quasi-depth-invariant, and depends on the ambient light strength. The optimal flux is lower than what a SPAD typically measures in real world scenarios, but surprisingly, considerably higher than what is conventionally suggested for avoiding distortions. We propose a simple, adaptive approach for achieving the optimal flux by attenuating incident flux based on an estimate of ambient light strength. Using extensive simulations and a hardware prototype, we show that the optimal flux criterion holds for several depth estimators, under a wide range of illumination conditions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Photon-Flooded,Single-Photon,3D,Cameras"
254,Acoustic Non-Line-Of-Sight Imaging,"Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging enables unprecedented capabilities in a wide range of applications, including robotic and machine vision, remote sensing, autonomous vehicle navigation, and medical imaging. Recent approaches to solving this challenging problem employ optical time-of-flight imaging systems with highly sensitive time-resolved photodetectors and ultra-fast pulsed lasers. However, despite recent successes in NLOS imaging using these systems, widespread implementation and adoption of the technology remains a challenge because of the requirement for specialized, expensive hardware. We introduce acoustic NLOS imaging, which is orders of magnitude less expensive than most optical systems and captures hidden 3D geometry at longer ranges with shorter acquisition times compared to state-of-the-art optical methods. Inspired by hardware setups used in radar and algorithmic approaches to model and invert wave-based image formation models developed in the seismic imaging community, we demonstrate a new approach to seeing around corners.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Acoustic,Non-Line-Of-Sight,Imaging"
255,Steady-State Non-Line-Of-Sight Imaging,"Conventional intensity cameras recover objects in the direct line-of-sight of the camera, whereas occluded scene parts are considered lost in this process. Non-line-of-sight imaging (NLOS) aims at recovering these occluded objects by analyzing their indirect reflections on visible scene surfaces. Existing NLOS methods temporally probe the indirect light transport to unmix light paths based on their travel time, which mandates specialized instrumentation that suffers from low photon efficiency, high cost, and mechanical scanning. We depart from temporal probing and demonstrate steady-state NLOS imaging using conventional intensity sensors and continuous illumination. Instead of assuming perfectly isotropic scattering, the proposed method exploits directionality in the hidden surface reflectance, resulting in (small) spatial variation of their indirect reflections for varying illumination. To tackle the shape-dependence of these variations, we propose a trainable architecture which learns to map diffuse indirect reflections to scene reflectance using only synthetic training data. Relying on consumer color image sensors, with high fill factor, high quantum efficiency and low read-out noise, we demonstrate high-fidelity color NLOS imaging for scene configurations tackled before with picosecond time resolution.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Steady-State,Non-Line-Of-Sight,Imaging"
256,A Theory of Fermat Paths for Non-Line-Of-Sight Shape Reconstruction,"We present a novel theory of Fermat paths of light between a known visible scene and an unknown object not in the line of sight of a transient camera. These light paths either obey specular reflection or are reflected by the object's boundary, and hence encode the shape of the hidden object. We prove that Fermat paths correspond to discontinuities in the transient measurements. We then derive a novel constraint that relates the spatial derivatives of the path lengths at these discontinuities to the surface normal. Based on this theory, we present an algorithm, called Fermat Flow, to estimate the shape of the non-line-of-sight object.  Our method allows, for the first time, accurate shape recovery of complex objects, ranging from diffuse to specular, that are hidden around the corner as well as hidden behind a diffuser. Finally, our approach is agnostic to the particular technology used for transient imaging. As such, we demonstrate mm-scale  shape recovery from pico-second scale transients using a SPAD and ultrafast laser, as well as micron-scale reconstruction  from femto-second scale transients using interferometry. We believe our work is a significant advance over the state-of-the-art in non-line-of-sight imaging.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Theory,of,Fermat,Paths,for,Non-Line-Of-Sight,Shape,Reconstruction"
257,End-To-End Projector Photometric Compensation,"Projector photometric compensation aims to modify a projector input image such that it can compensate for disturbance from the appearance of projection surface. In this paper, for the first time, we formulate the compensation problem as an end-to-end learning problem and propose a convolutional neural network, named CompenNet, to implicitly learn the complex compensation function. CompenNet consists of a UNet-like backbone network and an autoencoder subnet. Such architecture  encourages rich multi-level interactions between the camera-captured projection surface image and the input image, and thus captures both photometric and environment information of the projection surface. In addition, the visual details and interaction information are carried to deeper layers along the multi-level skip convolution layers. The architecture is of particular importance for the projector compensation task, for which only a small training dataset is allowed in practice. Another contribution we make is a novel evaluation benchmark, which is independent of system setup and thus quantitatively verifiable. Such benchmark is not previously available, to our best knowledge, due to the fact that conventional evaluation requests the hardware system to actually project the final results. Our key idea, motivated from our end-to-end problem formulation, is to use a reasonable surrogate to avoid such projection process so as to be setup-independent. Our method is evaluated carefully on the benchmark, and the results show that our end-to-end learning solution outperforms state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and quantitatively by a significant margin.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"End-To-End,Projector,Photometric,Compensation"
258,Bringing a Blurry Frame Alive at High Frame-Rate With an Event Camera,"Event-based cameras can measure intensity changes (called 'events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed motion and challenging lighting conditions. With the active pixel sensor (APS), the event camera allows simultaneous output of the intensity frames. However, the output images are captured at a relatively low frame-rate and often suffer from motion blur. A blurry image can be regarded as the integral of a sequence of latent images, while the events indicate the changes between the latent images. Therefore, we are able to model the blur-generation process by associating event data to a latent image. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective approach, the Event-based Double Integral (EDI) model, to reconstruct a high frame-rate, sharp video from a single blurry frame and its event data. The video generation is based on solving a simple non-convex optimization problem in a single scalar variable. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate the superiority of our EDI model and optimization method in comparison to the state-of-the-art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bringing,a,Blurry,Frame,Alive,at,High,Frame-Rate,With,an,Event,Camera"

We first learn motion representation from sharp videos in an unsupervised manner through training of a convolutional recurrent video autoencoder network that performs a surrogate task of video reconstruction. Once trained, it is employed for guided training of a motion encoder for blurred images. This network extracts embedded motion information from the blurred image to generate a sharp video in conjunction with the trained recurrent video decoder. As an intermediate step, we also design an efficient architecture that enables real-time single image deblurring and outperforms competing methods across all factors: accuracy, speed, and compactness. Experiments on real scenes and standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art and its ability to generate a plausible sequence of temporally consistent sharp frames.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bringing,Alive,Blurred,Moments"

To build this system we motivate and design a differentiable ""line prediction"" layer to be used as part of a neural network architecture, with which we can learn a system to regress from image pairs to motion blurred images that span the capture time of the input image pair. Training this model requires an abundance of data, and so we design and execute a strategy for using frame interpolation techniques to generate a large-scale synthetic dataset of motion blurred images and their respective inputs. We additionally capture a high quality test set of real motion blurred images, synthesized from slow motion videos, with which we evaluate our model against several baseline techniques that can be used to synthesize motion blur. Our model produces higher accuracy output than our baselines, and is several orders of magnitude faster than baselines with competitive accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Synthesize,Motion,Blur"
261,Underexposed Photo Enhancement Using Deep Illumination Estimation,"This paper presents a new neural network for enhancing underexposed photos. Instead of directly learning an image-to-image mapping as previous work, we introduce intermediate illumination in our network to associate the input with expected enhancement result, which augments the network's capability to learn complex photographic adjustment from expert-retouched input/output image pairs. Based on this model, we formulate a loss function that adopts constraints and priors on the illumination, prepare a new dataset of 3,000 underexposed image pairs, and train the network to effectively learn a rich variety of adjustment for diverse lighting conditions. By these means, our network is able to recover clear details, distinct contrast, and natural color in the enhancement results. We perform extensive experiments on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset and our new dataset, and show that our network is effective to deal with previously challenging images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Underexposed,Photo,Enhancement,Using,Deep,Illumination,Estimation"
262,Blind Visual Motif Removal From a Single Image,"Many images shared over the web include overlaid objects, or visual motifs, such as text, symbols or drawings, which add a description or decoration to the image. For example, decorative text that specifies where the image was taken, repeatedly appears across a variety of different images. Often, the reoccurring visual motif, is semantically similar, yet, differs in location, style and content (e.g. text placement, font and letters). This work proposes a deep learning based technique for blind removal of such objects. In the blind setting, the location and exact geometry of the motif are unknown. Our approach simultaneously estimates which pixels contain the visual motif, and synthesizes the underlying latent image. It is applied to a single input image, without any user assistance in specifying the location of the motif, achieving state-of-the-art results for blind removal of both opaque and semi-transparent visual motifs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Blind,Visual,Motif,Removal,From,a,Single,Image"
263,Non-Local Meets Global: An Integrated Paradigm for Hyperspectral Denoising,"Non-local low-rank tensor approximation has been developed as a state-of-the-art method for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising. Unfortunately, while their denoising performance benefits little from more spectral bands, the running time of these methods significantly increases. In this paper, we claim that the HSI lies in a global spectral low-rank subspace, and the spectral subspaces of each full band patch groups should lie in this global low-rank subspace. This motivates us to propose a unified spatial-spectral paradigm for HSI denoising. As the new model is hard to optimize, An efficient algorithm motivated by alternating minimization is developed. This is done by first learning a low-dimensional orthogonal basis and the related reduced image from the noisy HSI. Then, the non-local low-rank denoising and iterative regularization are developed to refine the reduced image and orthogonal basis, respectively. Finally, the experiments on synthetic and both real datasets demonstrate the superiority against the",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Non-Local,Meets,Global:,An,Integrated,Paradigm,for,Hyperspectral,Denoising"

Starting from Internet photos of a tourist landmark, we apply traditional 3D reconstruction to register the photos and approximate the scene as a point cloud. For each photo, we render the scene points into a deep framebuffer, and train a deep neural network to learn the mapping of these initial renderings to the actual photos. This rerendering network also takes as input a latent appearance vector and a semantic mask indicating the location of transient objects like pedestrians. The model is evaluated on several datasets of publicly available images spanning a broad range of illumination conditions. We create short videos that demonstrate realistic manipulation of the image viewpoint, appearance, and semantic labels.

To demonstrate the applicability of learned geodesic-aware representations, we propose fusion schemes which use GeoNet in conjunction with other baseline or backbone networks, such as PU-Net and PointNet++, for down-stream point cloud analysis.

266,MeshAdv: Adversarial Meshes for Visual Recognition,"Highly expressive models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to various applications. However, recent studies show that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted inputs aiming to mislead the predictions. Currently, the majority of these studies have focused on perturbation added to image pixels, while such manipulation is not physically realistic. Some works have tried to overcome this limitation by attaching printable 2D patches or painting patterns onto surfaces, but can be potentially defended because 3D shape features are intact. In this paper, we propose meshAdv to generate ""adversarial 3D meshes"" from objects that have rich shape features but minimal textural variation. To manipulate the shape or texture of the objects, we make use of a differentiable renderer to compute accurate shading on the shape and propagate the gradient. Extensive experiments show that the generated 3D meshes are effective in attacking both classifiers and object detectors. We evaluate the attack under different viewpoints. In addition, we design a pipeline to perform black-box attack on a photorealistic renderer with unknown rendering parameters.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MeshAdv:,Adversarial,Meshes,for,Visual,Recognition"

Given an image and a 2D location in that image, our CNN estimates a 5th order spherical harmonic representation of the lighting at the given location in less than 20ms on a laptop mobile graphics card. While existing approaches estimate a single, global lighting representation or require depth as input, our method reasons about local lighting without requiring any geometry information. We demonstrate, through quantitative experiments including a user study, that our results achieve lower lighting estimation errors and are preferred by users over the state-of-the-art. Our approach can be used directly for augmented reality applications, where a virtual object is relit realistically at any position in the scene in real-time.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fast,Spatially-Varying,Indoor,Lighting,Estimation"
268,Neural Illumination: Lighting Prediction for Indoor Environments,"This paper addresses the task of estimating the light arriving from all directions to a 3D point observed at a selected pixel in an RGB image.   This task is challenging because it requires predicting a mapping from a partial RGB observation by a camera to a complete illumination map for a different 3D point, which depends on the 3D location of the selected pixel, the distribution of unobserved light sources, the occlusions by scene geometry, etc.  Previous methods attempt to learn this complex mapping directly using a single black-box neural network which often fails to estimate high-frequency lighting details for scenes with complicated 3D geometry.  Instead, we propose ""Neural Illumination,"" a new approach that decomposes illumination prediction into several simpler differentiable sub-tasks: 1) geometry estimation, 2) scene completion, and 3) LDR-to-HDR estimation.  The advantage of this approach is that the sub-tasks are relatively easy to learn and can be trained with direct supervision, while the whole pipeline is fully differentiable and can be fine-tuned with end-to-end supervision.

Our key contribution is to provide a holistic view of both lighting modeling and estimation, solving both problems end-to-end. From a test image, our method can directly estimate an HDR environment map of the lighting without relying on analytical lighting models. We demonstrate the versatility and expressivity of our learned sky model and show that it can be used to recover plausible illumination, leading to visually pleasant virtual object insertions. To further evaluate our method, we capture a dataset of HDR 360deg panoramas and show through extensive validation that we significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Sky,Modeling,for,Single,Image,Outdoor,Lighting,Estimation"

In this paper, we propose a novel bidirectional learning framework for domain adaptation of segmentation. Using the bidirectional learning, the image translation model and the segmentation adaptation model can be learned alternatively and promote to each other.Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning algorithm to learn a better segmentation adaptation model and in return improve the image translation model.

To dynamically adjust the state of codebooks, we employ an Actor-Critic network to collaborate with the original deep network.

272,Strong-Weak Distribution Alignment for Adaptive Object Detection,"We propose an approach for unsupervised adaptation of object detectors from label-rich to label-poor domains which can significantly reduce annotation costs associated with detection. Recently, approaches that align distributions of source and target images using an adversarial loss have been proven effective for adapting object classifiers. However, for object detection, fully matching the entire distributions of source and target images to each other at the global image level may fail,  as domains could have distinct scene layouts and different combinations of objects. On the other hand, strong matching of local features such as texture and color makes sense, as it does not change category level semantics. This motivates us to propose a novel method for detector adaptation based on strong local alignment and weak global alignment. Our key contribution is the weak alignment model, which focuses the adversarial alignment loss on images that are globally similar and puts less emphasis on aligning images that are globally dissimilar. Additionally, we design the strong domain alignment model to only look at local receptive fields of the feature map. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method on four datasets comprising both large and small domain shifts.

In an effort to clarify the relationship between robustness and generalization, we assume an underlying, low-dimensional data manifold and show that: 1. regular adversarial examples leave the manifold; 2. adversarial examples constrained to the manifold, i.e., on-manifold adversarial examples, exist; 3. on-manifold adversarial examples are generalization errors, and on-manifold adversarial training boosts generalization; 4. regular robustness and generalization are not necessarily contradicting goals. These assumptions imply that both robust and accurate models are possible. However, different models (architectures, training strategies etc.) can exhibit different robustness and generalization characteristics.

Distinct to most of the existing defense mechanisms that require modifying the architecture/training of the target classifier which is not feasible in the real-world scenario, e.g., when a model has already been deployed, PAR is designed in the first place to provide proactive protection to an existing fixed model.

However, current prevailing training scheme follows the previous way of adding supervision to the last layer of the network only and propagating error information up layer-by-layer. In this paper, we propose Deeply-supervised Knowledge Synergy (DKS), a new method aiming to train CNNs with improved generalization ability for image classification tasks without introducing extra computational cost during inference. Inspired by the deeply-supervised learning scheme, we first append auxiliary supervision branches on top of certain intermediate network layers. While properly using auxiliary supervision can improve model accuracy to some degree, we go one step further to explore the possibility of utilizing the probabilistic knowledge dynamically learnt by the classifiers connected to the backbone network as a new regularization to improve the training. A novel synergy loss, which considers pairwise knowledge matching among all supervision branches, is presented. Intriguingly, it enables dense pairwise knowledge matching operations in both top-down and bottom-up directions at each training iteration, resembling a dynamic synergy process for the same task. We evaluate DKS on image classification datasets using state-of-the-art CNN architectures, and show that the models trained with it are consistently better than the corresponding counterparts. For instance, on the ImageNet classification benchmark, our ResNet-152 model outperforms the baseline model with a 1.47% margin in Top-1 accuracy.

We design a modular block implementing this connection style; it is equipped with two containers to which arbitrary paired operations are inserted. Adopting the ""unraveled"" view of the residual networks proposed by Veit et al., we point out that a stack of the proposed modular blocks allows the first operation in a block interact with the second operation in any subsequent blocks. Specifying the two operations in each of the stacked blocks, we build a complete network for each individual task of image restoration. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach on five image restoration tasks using nine datasets. The results show that the proposed networks with properly chosen paired operations outperform previous methods on almost all of the tasks and datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dual,Residual,Networks,Leveraging,the,Potential,of,Paired,Operations,for,Image,Restoration"

It is easy to collect a dataset with noisy labels, but such noise makes networks overfit seriously and accuracies drop dramatically. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end framework called PENCIL, which can update both network parameters and label estimations as label distributions. PENCIL is independent of the backbone network structure and does not need an auxiliary clean dataset or prior information about noise, thus it is more general and robust than existing methods and is easy to apply.

Our approach, named the Attention-guided Unified Network (AUNet), is a unified framework with two branches for FG and BG segmentation simultaneously. Two sources of attentions are added to the BG branch, namely, RPN and FG segmentation mask to provide object-level and pixel-level attentions, respectively.

281,OICSR: Out-In-Channel Sparsity Regularization for Compact Deep Neural Networks,"Channel pruning can significantly accelerate and compress deep neural networks. Many channel pruning works utilize structured sparsity regularization to zero out all the weights in some channels and automatically obtain structure-sparse network in training stage. However, these methods apply structured sparsity regularization on each layer separately where the correlations between consecutive layers are omitted. In this paper, we first combine one out-channel in current layer and the corresponding in-channel in next layer as a regularization group, namely out-in-channel. Our proposed Out-In-Channel Sparsity Regularization (OICSR) considers correlations between successive layers to further retain predictive power of the compact network. Training with OICSR thoroughly transfers discriminative features into a fraction of out-in-channels.

282,Semantically Aligned Bias Reducing Zero Shot Learning,"Zero shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by exploiting semantic relationships between seen and unseen classes. Two major problems faced by ZSL algorithms are the hubness problem and the bias towards the seen classes. Existing ZSL methods focus on only one of these problems in the conventional and generalized ZSL setting. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Semantically Aligned Bias Reducing (SABR) ZSL, which focuses on solving both the problems. It overcomes the hubness problem by learning a latent space that preserves the semantic relationship between the labels while encoding the discriminating information about the classes.  Further, we also propose ways to reduce bias of the seen classes through a simple cross-validation process in the inductive setting and a novel weak transfer constraint in the transductive setting.  Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets suggest that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by  1.5-9% in the conventional ZSL setting and by  2-14% in the generalized ZSL for both the inductive and transductive settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semantically,Aligned,Bias,Reducing,Zero,Shot,Learning"
283,Feature Space Perturbations Yield More Transferable Adversarial Examples,"Many recent works have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to quasi-imperceptible input perturbations, yet practitioners cannot fully explain this behavior. This work describes a transfer-based blackbox targeted adversarial attack of deep feature space representations that also provides insights into cross-model class representations of deep CNNs. The attack is explicitly designed for transferability and drives feature space representation of a source image at layer L towards the representation of a target image at L. The attack yields highly transferable targeted examples, which outperform competition winning methods by over 30% in targeted attack metrics. We also show the choice of L to generate examples from is important, transferability characteristics are blackbox model agnostic, and indicate that well trained deep models have similar highly-abstract representations.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Feature,Space,Perturbations,Yield,More,Transferable,Adversarial,Examples"

285,Accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks via Activation Map Compression,"The deep learning revolution brought us an extensive array of neural network architectures that achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of Computer Vision tasks including among others, classification, detection and segmentation. In parallel, we have also been observing an unprecedented demand in computational and memory requirements, rendering the efficient use of neural networks in low-powered devices virtually unattainable. Towards this end, we propose a three-stage compression and acceleration pipeline that sparsifies, quantizes and entropy encodes activation maps of Convolutional Neural Networks. Sparsification increases the representational power of activation maps leading to both acceleration of inference and higher model accuracy. Inception-V3 and MobileNet-V1 can be accelerated by as much as 1.6x with an increase in accuracy of 0.38% and 0.54% on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. Quantizing and entropy coding the sparser activation maps lead to higher compression over the baseline, reducing the memory cost of the network execution. Inception-V3 and MobileNet-V1 activation maps, quantized to 16 bits, are compressed by as much as 6x with an increase in accuracy of 0.36% and 0.55% respectively.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Accelerating,Convolutional,Neural,Networks,via,Activation,Map,Compression"
286,Knowledge Distillation via Instance Relationship Graph,"The key challenge of knowledge distillation is to extract general, moderate and sufficient knowledge from a teacher network to guide a student network. In this paper, a novel Instance Relationship Graph (IRG) is proposed for knowledge distillation. It models three kinds of knowledge, including instance features, instance relationships and feature space transformation, while the latter two kinds of knowledge are neglected by previous methods. Firstly, the IRG is constructed  to model the distilled knowledge of one network layer, by considering instance features and instance relationships as vertexes and edges respectively. Secondly, an IRG transformation is proposed to models the feature space transformation across layers. It is more moderate than directly mimicking the features at intermediate layers. Finally, hint loss functions are designed to force a student's IRGs to mimic the structures of a teacher's IRGs. The proposed method effectively captures the knowledge along the whole network via IRGs, and thus shows stable convergence and strong robustness to different network architectures. In addition, the proposed method shows superior performance over existing methods on datasets of various scales.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Knowledge,Distillation,via,Instance,Relationship,Graph"

In order to extract a line segment graph from an image, we further introduce the PPGNet, a convolutional neural network that directly infers a graph from an image.

288,Building Detail-Sensitive Semantic Segmentation Networks With Polynomial Pooling,"Semantic segmentation is an important computer vision task, which aims to allocate a semantic label to each pixel in an image. When training a segmentation model, it is common to fine-tune a classification network pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. However, as an intrinsic property of the classification model, invariance to spatial perturbation resulting from the lose of detail-sensitivity prevents segmentation networks from achieving high performance. The use of standard poolings is one of the key factors for this invariance. The most common standard poolings are max and average pooling. Max pooling can increase both the invariance to spatial perturbations and the non-linearity of the networks. Average pooling, on the other hand, is sensitive to spatial perturbations, but is a linear function. For semantic segmentation, we prefer both the preservation of detailed cues within a local feature region and non-linearity that increases a network's functional complexity. In this work, we propose a polynomial pooling (P-pooling) function that finds an intermediate form between max and average pooling to provide an optimally balanced and self-adjusted pooling strategy for semantic segmentation. The P-pooling is differentiable and can be applied into a variety of pre-trained networks. Extensive studies on the PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes and ADE20k datasets demonstrate the superiority of P-pooling over other poolings. Experiments on various network architectures and state-of-the-art training strategies also show that models with P-pooling layers consistently outperform those directly fine-tuned using pre-trained classification models.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Building,Detail-Sensitive,Semantic,Segmentation,Networks,With,Polynomial,Pooling"
289,Variational Bayesian Dropout With a Hierarchical Prior,"Variational dropout (VD) is a generalization of Gaussian dropout, which aims at inferring the posterior of network weights based on a log-uniform prior on them to learn these weights as well as dropout rate simultaneously. The log-uniform prior not only interprets the regularization capacity of Gaussian dropout in network training, but also underpins the inference of such posterior. However, the log-uniform prior is an improper prior (i.e., its integral is infinite), which causes the inference of posterior to be ill-posed, thus restricting the regularization performance of VD. To address this problem, we present a new generalization of Gaussian dropout, termed variational Bayesian dropout (VBD), which turns to exploit a hierarchical prior on the network weights and infer a new joint posterior. Specifically, we implement the hierarchical prior as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance sampled from a uniform hyper-prior. Then, we incorporate such a prior into inferring the joint posterior over network weights and the variance in the hierarchical prior, with which both the network training and dropout rate estimation can be cast into a joint optimization problem. More importantly, the hierarchical prior is a proper prior which enables the inference of posterior to be well-posed. In addition, we further show that the proposed VBD can be seamlessly applied to network compression. Experiments on classification and network compression demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed VBD in regularizing network training.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Variational,Bayesian,Dropout,With,a,Hierarchical,Prior"
290,AANet: Attribute Attention Network for Person Re-Identifications,"This paper proposes Attribute Attention Network (AANet), a new architecture that integrates person attributes and attribute attention maps into a classification framework to solve the person re-identification (re-ID) problem. Many person re-ID models typically employ semantic cues such as body parts or human pose to improve the re-ID performance. Attribute information, however, is often not utilized. The proposed AANet leverages on a baseline model that uses body parts and integrates the key attribute information in an unified learning framework. The AANet consists of a global person ID task, a part detection task and a crucial attribute detection task. By estimating the class responses of individual attributes and combining them to form the attribute attention map (AAM), a very strong discriminatory representation is constructed. The proposed AANet outperforms the best state-of-the-art method [??] using ResNet-50 by 3.36% in mAP and 3.12% in Rank-1 accuracy on DukeMTMC-reID dataset. On Market1501 dataset, AANet achieves 92.38% mAP and 95.10% Rank-1 accuracy with re-ranking,  outperforming [??], another state of the art method using ResNet-152, by 1.42% in mAP and 0.47% in Rank-1 accuracy. In addition, AANet can perform person attribute prediction (e.g., gender, hair length, clothing length etc.), and localize the attributes in the query image.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"AANet:,Attribute,Attention,Network,for,Person,Re-Identifications"
291,Overcoming Limitations of Mixture Density Networks: A Sampling and Fitting Framework for Multimodal Future Prediction,"Future prediction is a fundamental principle of intelligence that helps plan actions and avoid possible dangers. As the future is uncertain to a large extent, modeling the uncertainty and multimodality of the future states is of great relevance. Existing approaches are rather limited in this regard and mostly yield a single hypothesis of the future or, at the best, strongly constrained mixture components that suffer from instabilities in training and mode collapse. In this work, we present an approach that involves the prediction of several samples of the future with a winner-takes-all loss and iterative grouping of samples to multiple modes. Moreover, we discuss how to evaluate predicted multimodal distributions, including the common real scenario, where only a single sample from the ground-truth distribution is available for evaluation. We show on synthetic and real data that the proposed approach triggers good estimates of multimodal distributions and avoids mode collapse.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Overcoming,Limitations,of,Mixture,Density,Networks:,A,Sampling,and,Fitting,Framework,for,Multimodal,Future,Prediction"
292,A Main/Subsidiary Network Framework for Simplifying Binary Neural Networks,"To reduce memory footprint and run-time latency, techniques such as neural net-work pruning and binarization have been explored separately.  However, it is un-clear how to combine the best of the two worlds to get extremely small and efficient models.  In this paper, we, for the first time, define the filter-level pruning problem for binary neural networks, which cannot be solved by simply migrating existing structural pruning methods for full-precision models.  A novel learning-based approach is proposed to prune filters in our main/subsidiary network frame-work, where the main network is responsible for learning representative features to optimize the prediction performance, and the subsidiary component works as a filter selector on the main network. To avoid gradient mismatch when training the subsidiary component, we propose a layer-wise and bottom-up scheme.  We also provide the theoretical and experimental comparison between our learning-based and greedy rule-based methods.  Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach applied on several binary models,  including binarizedNIN, VGG-11, and ResNet-18, on various image classification datasets.  For bi-nary ResNet-18 on ImageNet, we use 78.6% filters but can achieve slightly better test error 49.87% (50.02%-0.15%) than the original model",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Main/Subsidiary,Network,Framework,for,Simplifying,Binary,Neural,Networks"

For classification and segmentation tasks, the approach and its subsequent variants/extensions are considered state-of-the-art. To date, the successful application of PointNet to point cloud registration has remained elusive. In this paper we argue that PointNet itself can be thought of as a learnable ""imaging"" function. As a consequence, classical vision algorithms for image alignment can be brought to bear on the problem -- namely the Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm. Our central innovations stem from: (i) how to modify the LK algorithm to accommodate the PointNet imaging function, and (ii) unrolling PointNet and the LK algorithm into a single trainable recurrent deep neural network. We describe the architecture, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art in several common registration scenarios. The architecture offers some remarkable properties including: generalization across shape categories and computational efficiency -- opening up new paths of exploration for the application of deep learning to point cloud registration.

294,Few-Shot Adaptive Faster R-CNN,"To mitigate the detection performance drop caused by domain shift, we aim to develop a novel few-shot adaptation approach that requires only a few target domain images with limited bounding box annotations. To this end, we first observe several significant challenges. First, the target domain data is highly insufficient, making most existing domain adaptation methods ineffective. Second, object detection involves simultaneous localization and classification, further complicating the model adaptation process. Third, the model suffers from over-adaptation (similar to overfitting when training with a few data example) and instability risk that may lead to degraded detection performance in the target domain. To address these challenges, we first introduce a pairing mechanism over source and target features to alleviate the issue of insufficient target domain samples. We then propose a bi-level module to adapt the source trained detector to the target domain: 1) the split pooling based image level adaptation module uniformly extracts and aligns paired local patch features over locations, with different scale and aspect ratio; 2) the instance level adaptation module semantically aligns paired object features while avoids inter-class confusion. Meanwhile, a source model feature regularization (SMFR) is applied to stabilize the adaptation process of the two modules. Combining these contributions gives a novel few-shot adaptive Faster-RCNN framework, termed FAFRCNN, which effectively adapts to target domain with a few labeled samples. Experiments with multiple datasets show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance under both the interested few-shot domain adaptation(FDA) and unsupervised domain adaptation(UDA) setting.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Few-Shot,Adaptive,Faster,R-CNN"
295,VRSTC: Occlusion-Free Video Person Re-Identification,"Video person re-identification (re-ID) plays an important role in surveillance video analysis. However, the performance of video re-ID degenerates severely under partial occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel network, called Spatio-Temporal Completion network (STCnet), to explicitly handle partial occlusion problem. Different from most previous works that discard the occluded frames, STCnet can recover the appearance of the occluded parts. For one thing, the spatial structure of a pedestrian frame can be used to predict the occluded body parts from the unoccluded body parts of this frame. For another, the temporal patterns of pedestrian sequence provide important clues to generate the contents of occluded parts. With the spatio-temporal information, STCnet can recover the appearance for the occluded parts, which could be leveraged with those unoccluded parts for more accurate video re-ID. By combining a re-ID network with STCnet, a video re-ID framework robust to partial occlusion (VRSTC) is proposed. Experiments on three challenging video re-ID databases demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"VRSTC:,Occlusion-Free,Video,Person,Re-Identification"
296,Compact Feature Learning for Multi-Domain Image Classification,"The goal of multi-domain learning is to improve the performance over multiple domains by making full use of all training data from them. However, variations of feature distributions across different domains result in a non-trivial solution of multi-domain learning. The state-of-the-art work regarding multi-domain classification aims to extract domain-invariant features and domain-specific features independently. However, they view the distributions of features from different classes as a general distribution and try to match these distributions across domains, which lead to the mixture of features from different classes across domains and degrade the performance of classification. Additionally, existing works only force the shared features among domains to be orthogonal to the features in the domain-specific network. However, redundant features between the domain-specific networks still remain, which may shrink the discriminative ability of domain-specific features. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end network to obtain the more optimal features, which we call compact features. We propose to extract the domain-invariant features by matching the joint distributions of different domains, which have dis- tinct boundaries between different classes. Moreover, we add an orthogonal constraint between the private features across domains to ensure the discriminative ability of the domain-specific space. The proposed method is validated on three landmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Compact,Feature,Learning,for,Multi-Domain,Image,Classification"
297,Adaptive Transfer Network for Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification,"Recent deep learning based person re-identification approaches have steadily improved the performance for benchmarks, however they often fail to generalize well from one domain to another. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive transfer network (ATNet) for effective cross-domain person re-identification. ATNet looks into the essential causes of domain gap and addresses it following the principle of ""divide-and-conquer"".  It decomposes the complicated cross-domain transfer into a set of factor-wise sub-transfers, each of which concentrates on style transfer with respect to a certain imaging factor, e.g., illumination, resolution and camera view etc. An adaptive ensemble strategy is proposed to fuse factor-wise transfers by perceiving the affect magnitudes of various factors on images. Such ""decomposition-and-ensemble"" strategy gives ATNet the capability of precise style transfer at factor level and eventually effective transfer across domains. In particular, ATNet consists of a transfer network composed by multiple factor-wise CycleGANs and an ensemble CycleGAN as well as a selection network that infers the affects of different factors on transferring each image. Extensive experimental results on  three widely-used datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and PRID2011 have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ATNet with significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Adaptive,Transfer,Network,for,Cross-Domain,Person,Re-Identification"
298,Large-Scale Few-Shot Learning: Knowledge Transfer With Class Hierarchy,"Recently, large-scale few-shot learning (FSL) becomes topical. It is discovered that, for a large-scale FSL problem with 1,000 classes in the source domain, a strong baseline emerges, that is, simply training a deep feature embedding model using the aggregated source classes and performing nearest neighbor (NN) search using the learned features on the target classes. The state-of-the-art large-scale FSL methods struggle to beat this baseline, indicating intrinsic limitations on scalability. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel large-scale FSL model by learning transferable visual features with the class hierarchy which encodes the semantic relations between source and target classes. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms not only the NN baseline but also the state-of-the-art alternatives. Furthermore, we show that the proposed model can be easily extended to the large-scale zero-shot learning (ZSL) problem and also achieves the state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Large-Scale,Few-Shot,Learning:,Knowledge,Transfer,With,Class,Hierarchy"

We are interested in moving object detection in applications involving time-lapse image sequences for which current methods mistakenly group moving objects and illumination changes into foreground. Our method relies on the multilinear (tensor) data low-rank and sparse decomposition framework to address the weaknesses of existing methods. The key to our proposed method is to create first a set of prior maps that can characterize the changes in the image sequence due to illumination. We show that they can be detected by a k-support norm. To deal with concurrent, two types of changes, we employ two regularization terms, one for detecting moving objects and the other for accounting for illumination changes, in the tensor low-rank and sparse decomposition formulation. Through comprehensive experiments using challenging datasets, we show that our method demonstrates a remarkable ability to detect moving objects under discontinuous change in illumination, and outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions to this challenging problem.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Moving,Object,Detection,Under,Discontinuous,Change,in,Illumination,Using,Tensor,Low-Rank,and,Invariant,Sparse,Decomposition"

The proposed framework utilizes a novel lightweight stackable decoder-encoder module which uses convolutional re-sampling layers to improve features while maintaining efficient memory and runtime cost. Unlike previous cascaded detection systems, our proposed framework is designed within a region proposal network and thus retains greater context of nearby detections compared to independently processed RoI systems. We explicitly encourage increasing levels of precision by assigning strict labeling policies to each consecutive phase such that early phases develop features primarily focused on achieving high recall and later on accurate precision. In consequence, the final feature maps form more peaky radial gradients emulating from the centroids of unique pedestrians. Using our proposed autoregressive framework leads to new state-of-the-art performance on the reasonable and occlusion settings of the Caltech pedestrian dataset, and achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pedestrian,Detection,With,Autoregressive,Network,Phases"
301,All You Need Is a Few Shifts: Designing Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification,"Shift operation is an efficient alternative over depthwise separable convolution. However, it is still bottlenecked by its implementation manner, namely memory movement. To put this direction forward, a new and novel basic component named Sparse Shift Layer (SSL) is introduced in this paper to construct efficient convolutional neural networks. In this family of architectures, the basic block is only composed by 1x1 convolutional layers with only a few shift operations applied to the intermediate feature maps. To make this idea feasible, we introduce shift operation penalty during optimization and further propose a quantization-aware shift learning method to impose the learned displacement more friendly for inference. Extensive ablation studies indicate that only a few shift operations are sufficient to provide spatial information communication. Furthermore, to maximize the role of SSL, we redesign an improved network architecture to Fully Exploit the limited capacity of neural Network (FE-Net).

302,Stochastic Class-Based Hard Example Mining for Deep Metric Learning,"Performance of deep metric learning depends heavily on the capability of mining hard negative examples during training.  However, many metric learning algorithms often require intractable computational cost due to frequent feature computations and nearest neighbor searches in a large-scale dataset. As a result, existing approaches often suffer from trade-off between training speed and prediction accuracy. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a stochastic hard negative mining method. Our key idea is to adopt class signatures that keep track of feature embedding online with minor additional cost during training, and identify hard negative example candidates using the signatures. Given an anchor instance, our algorithm first selects a few hard negative classes based on the class-to-sample distances and then performs a refined search in an instance-level only from the selected classes. As most of the classes are discarded at the first step, it is much more efficient than exhaustive search while effectively mining a large number of hard examples. Our experiment shows that the proposed technique improves image retrieval accuracy substantially; it achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the several standard benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Stochastic,Class-Based,Hard,Example,Mining,for,Deep,Metric,Learning"
303,Revisiting Local Descriptor Based Image-To-Class Measure for Few-Shot Learning,"Few-shot learning in image classification aims to learn a classifier to classify images when only few training examples are available for each class. Recent work has achieved promising classification performance, where an image-level feature based measure is usually used. In this paper, we argue that a measure at such a level may not be effective enough in light of the scarcity of examples in few-shot learning. Instead, we think a local descriptor based image-to-class measure should be taken, inspired by its surprising success in the heydays of local invariant features. Specifically, building upon the recent episodic training mechanism, we propose a Deep Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DN4 in short) and train it in an end-to-end manner. Its key difference from the literature is the replacement of the image-level feature based measure in the final layer by a local descriptor based image-to-class measure. This measure is conducted online via a k-nearest neighbor search over the deep local descriptors of convolutional feature maps. The proposed DN4 not only learns the optimal deep local descriptors for the image-to-class measure, but also utilizes the higher efficiency of such a measure in the case of example scarcity, thanks to the exchangeability of visual patterns across the images in the same class. Our work leads to a simple, effective, and computationally efficient framework for few-shot learning. Experimental study on benchmark datasets consistently shows its superiority over the related state-of-the-art, with the largest absolute improvement of 17% over the next best.

In this paper, we first investigate the deficiency of the existing curve detection methods and then propose a novel Conditional Spatial Expansion (CSE) mechanism to improve the performance of curve detection. Instead of regarding the curve text detection as a polygon regression or a segmentation problem, we formulate it as a sequence prediction on the spatial domain. CSE starts with a seed arbitrarily chosen within a text region and progressively merges neighborhood regions based on the extracted local features by a CNN and contextual information of merged regions. The CSE is highly parameterized and can be seamlessly integrated into existing object detection frameworks. Enhanced by the data-dependent CSE mechanism, our curve text detection system provides robust instance-level text region extraction with minimal post-processing. The analysis experiment shows that our CSE can handle texts with various shapes, sizes, and orientations, and can effectively suppress the false-positives coming from text-like textures or unexpected texts included in the same RoI. Compared with the existing curve text detection algorithms, our method is more robust and enjoys a simpler processing flow. It also creates a new state-of-art performance on curve text benchmarks with F-measurement of up to 78.4%.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Robust,Curve,Text,Detection,With,Conditional,Spatial,Expansion"
305,Revisiting Perspective Information for Efficient Crowd Counting,"Crowd counting is the task of estimating people numbers in crowd images. Modern crowd counting methods employ deep neural networks to estimate crowd counts via crowd density regressions. A major challenge of this task lies in the perspective distortion, which results in drastic person scale change in an image. Density regression on the small person area is in general very hard. In this work, we propose a perspective-aware convolutional neural network (PACNN) for efficient crowd counting, which integrates the perspective information into density regression to provide additional knowledge of the person scale change in an image. Ground truth perspective maps are firstly generated for training; PACNN is then specifically designed to predict multi-scale perspective maps and encode them as perspective-aware weighting layers in the network to adaptively combine the outputs of multi-scale density maps. The weights are learned at every pixel of the maps such that the final density combination is robust to the perspective distortion. We conduct extensive experiments on the ShanghaiTech, WorldExpo'10, UCF_CC_50, and UCSD datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PACNN over the state-of-the-art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Revisiting,Perspective,Information,for,Efficient,Crowd,Counting"

In this paper, we develop an effective and efficient universal object detection system that is capable of working on various image domains, from human faces and traffic signs to medical CT images. Unlike multi-domain models, this universal model does not require prior knowledge of the domain of interest. This is achieved by the introduction of a new family of adaptation layers, based on the principles of squeeze and excitation, and a new domain-attention mechanism. In the proposed universal detector, all parameters and computations are shared across domains, and a single network processes all domains all the time. Experiments, on a newly established universal object detection benchmark of 11 diverse datasets, show that the proposed detector outperforms a bank of individual detectors, a multi-domain detector, and a baseline universal detector, with a 1.3x parameter increase over a single-domain baseline detector.

For this goal, prior work typically uses the triplet or N-pair loss, specified in terms of either l2-distances or dot-products between deep features. However, such formulations seem poorly  suited to the highly non-Euclidean deep feature space. Our first contribution is in specifying the N-pair loss in terms of manifold similarities between deep features. We introduce a new time- and memory-efficient method for estimating the manifold similarities by using a closed-form convergence solution of the Random Walk algorithm. Our efficiency comes, in part, from following the recent work that randomly partitions the deep feature space, and expresses image distances via representatives of the resulting subspaces, a.k.a. proxies.

308,Quantization Networks,"Although deep neural networks are highly effective, their high computational and memory costs severely hinder their applications to portable devices. As a consequence, lowbit quantization, which converts a full-precision neural network into a low-bitwidth integer version, has been an active and promising research topic. Existing methods formulate the low-bit quantization of networks as an approximation or optimization problem. Approximation-based methods confront the gradient mismatch problem, while optimizationbased methods are only suitable for quantizing weights and can introduce high computational cost during the training stage. In this paper, we provide a simple and uniform way for weights and activations quantization by formulating it as a differentiable non-linear function. The quantization function is represented as a linear combination of several Sigmoid functions with learnable biases and scales that could be learned in a lossless and end-to-end manner via continuous relaxation of the steepness of Sigmoid functions. Extensive experiments on image classification and object detection tasks show that our quantization networks outperform state-of-the-art methods. We believe that the proposed method will shed new lights on the interpretation of neural network quantization.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Quantization,Networks"
309,RES-PCA: A Scalable Approach to Recovering Low-Rank Matrices,"Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has drawn significant attentions due to its powerful capability in recovering low-rank matrices as well as successful appplications in various real world problems. The current state-of-the-art algorithms usually need to solve singular value decomposition of large matrices, which generally has at least a quadratic or even cubic complexity. This drawback has limited the application of RPCA in solving real world problems. To combat this drawback, in this paper we propose a new type of RPCA method, RES-PCA, which is linearly efficient and scalable in both data size and dimension. For comparison purpose, AltProj, an existing scalable approach to RPCA requires the precise knowlwdge of the true rank; otherwise, it may fail to recover low-rank matrices. By contrast, our method works with or without knowing the true rank; even when both methods work, our method is faster. Extensive experiments have been performed and testified to the effectiveness of proposed method quantitatively and in visual quality, which suggests that our method is suitable to be employed as a light-weight, scalable component for RPCA in any application pipelines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"RES-PCA:,A,Scalable,Approach,to,Recovering,Low-Rank,Matrices"
310,Occlusion-Net: 2D/3D Occluded Keypoint Localization Using Graph Networks,"We present Occlusion-Net, a framework to predict 2D and 3D locations of occluded keypoints for objects, in a largely self-supervised manner. We use an off-the-shelf detector as input (like MaskRCNN) that is trained only on visible key point annotations. This is the only supervision used in this work. A graph encoder network then explicitly classifies invisible edges and a graph decoder network corrects the occluded keypoint locations from the initial detector. Central to this work is a trifocal tensor loss that provides indirect self-supervision for occluded keypoint locations that are visible in other views of the object. The 2D keypoints are then passed into a 3D graph network that estimates the 3D shape and camera pose using the self-supervised re-projection loss. At test time, our approach successfully localizes keypoints in a single view under a diverse set of severe occlusion settings. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach on synthetic CAD data as well as a large image set capturing vehicles at many busy city intersections. As an interesting aside, we compare the accuracy of human labels of invisible keypoints against those obtained from geometric trifocal-tensor loss.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Occlusion-Net:,2D/3D,Occluded,Keypoint,Localization,Using,Graph,Networks"
311,Efficient Featurized Image Pyramid Network for Single Shot Detector,"Single-stage object detectors have recently gained popularity due to their combined advantage of high detection accuracy and real-time speed. However, while promising results have been achieved by these detectors on standard-sized objects, their performance on small objects is far from satisfactory. To detect very small/large objects, classical pyramid representation can be exploited, where an image pyramid is used to build a feature pyramid (featurized image pyramid), enabling detection across a range of scales. Existing single-stage detectors avoid such a featurized image pyramid representation due to its memory and time complexity. In this paper, we introduce a light-weight architecture to efficiently produce featurized image pyramid in a single-stage detection framework. The resulting multi-scale features are then injected into the prediction layers of the detector using an attention module. The performance of our detector is validated on two benchmarks: PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. For a 300x300 input, our detector operates at 111 frames per second (FPS) on a Titan X GPU, providing state-of-the-art detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 testset. On the MS COCO testset, our detector achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing all existing single-stage methods in the case of single-scale inference.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Efficient,Featurized,Image,Pyramid,Network,for,Single,Shot,Detector"

Our experiments show that all these tasks are complementary  and help the network learn better representations by fusing information at various levels.

We aim to adapt to both domains by specializing batch normalization layers in convolutional neural networks while allowing them to share all other model parameters, which is realized by a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, we estimate pseudo-labels for the examples in the target domain using an external unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm---for example, MSTN or CPUA---integrating the proposed domain-specific batch normalization. The second stage learns the final models using a multi-task classification loss for the source and target domains. Note that the two domains have separate batch normalization layers in both stages. Our framework can be easily incorporated into the domain adaptation techniques based on deep neural networks with batch normalization layers. We also present that our approach can be extended to the problem with multiple source domains. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy in the standard setting and the multi-source domain adaption scenario.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Domain-Specific,Batch,Normalization,for,Unsupervised,Domain,Adaptation"
314,Grid R-CNN,"This paper proposes a novel object detection framework named Grid R-CNN, which adopts a grid guided localization mechanism for accurate object detection. Different from the traditional regression based methods, the Grid R-CNN captures the spatial information explicitly and enjoys the position sensitive property of fully convolutional architecture. Instead of using only two independent points, we design a multi-point supervision formulation to encode more clues in order to reduce the impact of inaccurate prediction of specific points. To take the full advantage of the correlation of points in a grid, we propose a two-stage information fusion strategy to fuse feature maps of neighbor grid points. The grid guided localization approach is easy to be extended to different state-of-the-art detection frameworks. Grid R-CNN leads to high quality object localization, and experiments demonstrate that it achieves a 4.1% AP gain at IoU=0.8 and a 10.0% AP gain at IoU=0.9 on COCO benchmark compared to Faster R-CNN with Res50 backbone and FPN architecture.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Grid,R-CNN"
315,MetaCleaner: Learning to Hallucinate Clean Representations for Noisy-Labeled Visual Recognition,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable successes in large-scale visual recognition. However, they often suffer from overfitting under noisy labels. To alleviate this problem, we propose a conceptually simple but effective MetaCleaner, which can learn to hallucinate a clean representation of an object category, according to a small noisy subset from the same category. Specially, MetaCleaner consists of two flexible submodules. The first submodule, namely Noisy Weighting, can estimate the confidence scores of all the images in the noisy subset, by analyzing their deep features jointly. The second submodule, namely Clean Hallucinating, can generate a clean representation from the noisy subset, by summarizing the noisy images with their confidence scores. Via MetaCleaner, DNNs can strengthen its robustness to noisy labels, as well as enhance its generalization capacity with richer data diversity. Moreover, MetaCleaner can be easily integrated into the standard training procedure of DNNs, which promotes its value for real-life applications. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks in noisy-labeled recognition, i.e., Food-101N and Clothing1M. For both datasets, our MetaCleaner significantly outperforms baselines, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MetaCleaner:,Learning,to,Hallucinate,Clean,Representations,for,Noisy-Labeled,Visual,Recognition"
316,"Mapping, Localization and Path Planning for Image-Based Navigation Using Visual Features and Map","Building on progress in feature representations for image retrieval, image-based localization has seen a surge of research interest. Image-based localization has the advantage of being inexpensive and efficient, often avoiding the use of 3D metric maps altogether. That said, the need to maintain a large amount of reference images as an effective support of localization in a scene, nonetheless calls for them to be organized in a map structure of some kind. The problem of localization often arises as part of a navigation process. We are, therefore, interested in summarizing the reference images as a set of landmarks, which meet the requirements for image-based navigation. A contribution of this paper is to formulate such a set of requirements for the two sub-tasks involved: compact map construction and accurate self localization. These requirements are then exploited for compact map representation and accurate self-localization, using the framework of a network flow problem. During this process, we formulate the map construction and self-localization problems as convex quadratic and second-order cone programs, respectively. We evaluate our methods on publicly available indoor and outdoor datasets, where they outperform existing methods significantly.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mapping,,Localization,and,Path,Planning,for,Image-Based,Navigation,Using,Visual,Features,and,Map"
317,Triply Supervised Decoder Networks for Joint Detection and Segmentation,"Joint object detection and semantic segmentation is essential in many fields such as self-driving cars. An initial attempt towards this goal is to simply share a single network for multi-task learning. We argue that it does not make full use of the fact that detection and segmentation are mutually beneficial. In this paper, we propose a framework called TripleNet to deeply boost these two tasks. On the one hand, to deeply join the two tasks at different scales, triple supervisions including detection-oriented supervision and class-aware/agnostic segmentation supervisions are imposed on each layer of the decoder. Class-agnostic segmentation provides an objectness prior to detection and segmentation. On the other hand, to further intercross the two tasks and refine the features in each scale, two light-weight modules (i.e., the inner-connected module and the attention skip-layer fusion) are incorporated. Because segmentation supervision on each decoder layer are not performed at the test stage and two added modules are light-weight, the proposed TripleNet can run at a real-time speed (16 fps). Experiments on the VOC 2007/2012 and COCO datasets show that TripleNet outperforms all the other one-stage methods on both two tasks (e.g., 81.9% mAP and 83.3% mIoU on VOC 2012, and 37.1% mAP and 59.6% mIoU on COCO) by a single network.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Triply,Supervised,Decoder,Networks,for,Joint,Detection,and,Segmentation"
318,Leveraging the Invariant Side of Generative Zero-Shot Learning,"Conventional zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods generally learn an embedding, e.g., visual-semantic mapping, to handle the unseen visual samples via an indirect manner. In this paper, we take the advantage of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and propose a novel method, named leveraging invariant side GAN (LisGAN), which can directly generate the unseen features from random noises which are conditioned by the semantic descriptions. Specifically, we train a conditional Wasserstein GANs in which the generator synthesizes fake unseen features from noises and the discriminator distinguishes the fake from real via a minimax game. Considering that one semantic description can correspond to various synthesized visual samples, and the semantic description, figuratively, is the soul of the generated features, we introduce soul samples as the invariant side of generative zero-shot learning in this paper. A soul sample is the meta-representation of one class. It visualizes the most semantically-meaningful aspects of each sample in the same category. We regularize that each generated sample (the varying side of generative ZSL) should be close to at least one soul sample (the invariant side) which has the same class label with it. At the zero-shot recognition stage, we propose to use two classifiers, which are deployed in a cascade way, to achieve a coarse-to-fine result. Experiments on five popular benchmarks verify that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-the-art methods with significant improvements.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Leveraging,the,Invariant,Side,of,Generative,Zero-Shot,Learning"
319,Exploring the Bounds of the Utility of Context for Object Detection,"The recurring context in which objects appear holds valuable information that can be employed to predict their existence. This intuitive observation indeed led many researchers to endow appearance-based detectors with explicit reasoning about context. The underlying thesis suggests that stronger contextual relations would facilitate greater improvements in detection capacity. In practice, however, the observed improvement in many case is modest at best, and often only marginal. In this work we seek to improve our understanding of this phenomenon, in part by pursuing an opposite approach. Instead of attempting to improve detection scores by employing context, we treat the utility of context as an optimization problem: to what extent can detection scores be improved by considering context or any other kind of additional information? With this approach we explore the bounds on improvement by using contextual relations between objects and provide a tool for identifying the most helpful ones. We show that simple co-occurrence relations can often provide large gains, while in other cases a significant improvement is simply impossible or impractical with either co-occurrence or more precise spatial relations. To better understand these results we then analyze the ability of context to handle different types of false detections, revealing that tested contextual information cannot ameliorate localization errors, severely limiting its gains. These and additional insights further our understanding on where and why utilization of context for object detection succeeds and fails.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Exploring,the,Bounds,of,the,Utility,of,Context,for,Object,Detection"
320,A-CNN: Annularly Convolutional Neural Networks on Point Clouds,"Analyzing the geometric and semantic properties of 3D point clouds through the deep networks is still challenging due to the irregularity and sparsity of samplings of their geometric structures. This paper presents a new method to define and compute convolution directly on 3D point clouds by the proposed annular convolution. This new convolution operator can better capture the local neighborhood geometry of each point by specifying the (regular and dilated) ring-shaped structures and directions in the computation. It can adapt to the geometric variability and scalability at the signal processing level. We apply it to the developed hierarchical neural networks for object classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation in large-scale scenes.

Taking an image as input, it first exploits a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone to predict energy maps, which are further utilized to construct an energy function. A polygon-based contour is then evolved via minimizing the energy function, of which the minimum defines the final segmentation. Instead of parameterizing the contour using Euclidean coordinates, we adopt polar coordinates, i.e., rays, which not only prevents self-intersection but also simplifies the design of the energy function. Moreover, we propose a loss function that directly encourages the contours to match building boundaries. Our DARNet is trained end-to-end by back-propagating through the energy minimization and the backbone CNN, which makes the CNN adapt to the dynamics of the contour evolution. Experiments on three building instance segmentation datasets demonstrate our DARNet achieves either state-of-the-art or comparable performances to other competitors.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DARNet:,Deep,Active,Ray,Network,for,Building,Segmentation"

The embeddings are computed using a lightweight neural network operating on the points' local neighborhood. Finally, we formulate point cloud oversegmentation as a graph partition problem with respect to the learned embeddings.  This new approach allows us to set a new state-of-the-art in point cloud oversegmentation by a significant margin, on a dense indoor dataset (S3DIS) and a sparse outdoor one (vKITTI). Our best solution requires over five times fewer superpoints to reach similar performance than previously published methods on S3DIS.

323,Graphonomy: Universal Human Parsing via Graph Transfer Learning,"Prior highly-tuned human parsing models tend to fit towards each dataset in a specific domain or with discrepant label granularity, and can hardly be adapted to other human parsing tasks without extensive re-training. In this paper, we aim to learn a single universal human parsing model that can tackle all kinds of human parsing needs by unifying label annotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity. This poses many fundamental learning challenges, e.g. discovering underlying semantic structures among different label granularity, performing proper transfer learning across different image domains, and identifying and utilizing label redundancies across related tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a new universal human parsing agent, named ""Graphonomy"", which incorporates hierarchical graph transfer learning upon the conventional parsing network to encode the underlying label semantic structures and propagate relevant semantic information. In particular, Graphonomy first learns and propagates compact high-level graph representation among the labels within one dataset via Intra-Graph Reasoning, and then transfers semantic information across multiple datasets via Inter-Graph Transfer. Various graph transfer dependencies (e.g., similarity, linguistic knowledge) between different datasets are analyzed and encoded to enhance graph transfer capability. By distilling universal semantic graph representation to each specific task, Graphonomy is able to predict all levels of parsing labels in one system without piling up the complexity. Experimental results show Graphonomy effectively achieves the state-of-the-art results on three human parsing benchmarks as well as advantageous universal human parsing performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Graphonomy:,Universal,Human,Parsing,via,Graph,Transfer,Learning"

Our network is fully convolutional with two decoder branches for the foreground and background classification respectively. Then a fusion branch is used to integrate the two classification results which gives rise to alpha values as the soft segmentation result. This design provides more degrees of freedom than a single decoder branch for the network to obtain better alpha values during training. The network can implicitly produce trimaps without user interaction, which is easy to use for novices without expertise in digital matting.

Most of the previous works however focus on region accuracy but not on the boundary quality.

Specifically, the architecture is composed of a densely supervised Encoder-Decoder network and a residual refinement module, which are respectively in charge of saliency prediction and saliency map refinement. The hybrid loss guides the network to learn the transformation between the input image and the ground truth in a three-level hierarchy -- pixel-, patch- and map- level -- by fusing Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) losses. Equipped with the hybrid loss, the proposed predict-refine architecture is able to effectively segment the salient object regions and accurately predict the fine structures with clear boundaries. Experimental results on six public datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in terms of regional and boundary evaluation measures.

Recent works construct the multi-scale context by aggregating convolutional feature maps extracted by different levels of a deep neural network. This is typically done by propagating and fusing features in a one-directional, top-down and bottom-up, manner. In this work, we introduce ZigZagNet, which aggregates a richer multi-context feature map by using not only dense top-down and bottom-up propagation, but also by introducing pathways crossing between different levels of the top-down and the bottom-up hierarchies, in a zig-zag fashion. Furthermore, the context information is exchanged and aggregated over multiple stages, where the fused feature maps from one stage are fed into the next one, yielding a more comprehensive context for improved segmentation performance.

The Level Set Method can handle objects with complex shapes and topological changes such as merging and splitting, thus able to deal with occluded objects and objects with holes. We propose Deep Extreme Level Set Evolution that combines powerful CNN models with level set optimization in an end-to-end fashion. Our method learns to predict evolution parameters conditioned on the image and evolves the predicted initial contour to produce the final result.

329,Leveraging Crowdsourced GPS Data for Road Extraction From Aerial Imagery,"Deep learning is revolutionizing the mapping industry. Under lightweight human curation, computer has generated almost half of the roads in Thailand on Open- StreetMap (OSM) using high resolution aerial imagery. Bing maps are displaying 125 million computer generated building polygons in the U.S. While tremendously more efficient than manual mapping, one cannot map out everything from the air. Especially for roads, a small prediction gap by image occlusion renders the entire road useless for routing. Misconnections can be more dangerous. Therefore computer-based mapping often requires local verifications, which is still labor intensive. In this paper, we propose to leverage crowdsourced GPS data to improve and support road extraction from aerial imagery. Through novel data augmentation, GPS rendering, and 1D transpose convolution techniques, we show almost 5% improvements over previous competition winning models, and much better robustness when predicting new areas without any new training data or domain adaptation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Leveraging,Crowdsourced,GPS,Data,for,Road,Extraction,From,Aerial,Imagery"

Current context based segmentation methods differ with each other in how to construct context features and perform differently in practice. This paper firstly introduces three desirable properties of context features in segmentation task. Specially, we find that Global-guided Local Affinity (GLA) can play a vital role in constructing effective context features, while this property has been largely ignored in previous works. Based on this analysis, this paper proposes Adaptive Pyramid Context Network (APCNet) for semantic segmentation. APCNet adaptively constructs multi-scale contextual representations with multiple well-designed Adaptive Context Modules (ACMs). Specifically, each ACM leverages a global image representation as a guidance to estimate the local affinity coefficients for each sub-region, and then calculates a context vector with these affinities. We empirically evaluate our APCNet on three semantic segmentation and scene parsing datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012, Pascal-Context, and ADE20K dataset.

In this paper, we introduce a numerical procedure called isospectralization, consisting of deforming one shape to make its Laplacian spectrum match that of another.

To overcome these limitations, we design a new non-parametric task dependence estimation procedure that automatically aligns evaluations of heterogeneous predictors across disjoint feature sets. Our algorithm is instantiated as a robust manifold diffusion process that jointly refines the estimated predictor alignments and the corresponding task dependence.

Second, we propose a method for robustly estimating the fluorescent color via MAP estimation by taking the prior knowledge with respect to fluorescent colors into consideration. We conducted a number of experiments by using both synthetic and real images, and confirmed that our proposed method works better than the closely related state-of-the-art method and enables us to separate reflective and fluorescent components even from a single image.

337,Depth From a Polarisation + RGB Stereo Pair,"In this paper, we propose a hybrid depth imaging system in which a polarisation camera is augmented by a second image from a standard digital camera. For this modest increase in equipment complexity over conventional shape-from-polarisation, we obtain a number of benefits that enable us to overcome longstanding problems with the polarisation shape cue. The stereo cue provides a depth map which, although coarse, is metrically accurate. This is used as a guide surface for disambiguation of the polarisation surface normal estimates using a higher order graphical model. In turn, these are used to estimate diffuse albedo. By extending a previous shape-from-polarisation method to the perspective case, we show how to compute dense, detailed maps of absolute depth, while retaining a linear formulation. We show that our hybrid method is able to recover dense 3D geometry that is superior to state-of-the-art shape-from-polarisation or two view stereo alone.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Depth,From,a,Polarisation,+,RGB,Stereo,Pair"
338,Rethinking the Evaluation of Video Summaries,"Video summarization is a technique to create a short skim of the original video while preserving the main stories/content. There exists a substantial interest in automatizing this process due to the rapid growth of the available material. The recent progress has been facilitated by public benchmark datasets, which enable easy and fair comparison of methods. Currently the established evaluation protocol is to compare the generated summary with respect to a set of reference summaries provided by the dataset. In this paper, we will provide in-depth assessment of this pipeline using two popular benchmark datasets. Surprisingly, we observe that randomly generated summaries achieve comparable or better performance to the state-of-the-art. In some cases, the random summaries outperform even the human generated summaries in leave-one-out experiments. Moreover, it turns out that the video segmentation, which is often considered as a fixed pre-processing method, has the most significant impact on the performance measure. Based on our observations, we propose alternative approaches for assessing the importance scores as well as an intuitive visualization of correlation between the estimated scoring and human annotations.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Rethinking,the,Evaluation,of,Video,Summaries"
339,What Object Should I Use? - Task Driven Object Detection,"When humans have to solve everyday tasks, they simply pick the objects that are most suitable. While the question which object should one use for a specific task sounds trivial for humans, it is very difficult to answer for robots or other autonomous systems. This issue, however, is not addressed by current benchmarks for object detection that focus on detecting object categories. We therefore introduce the COCO-Tasks dataset which comprises about 40,000 images where the most suitable objects for 14 tasks have been annotated. We furthermore propose an approach that detects the most suitable objects for a given task. The approach builds on a Gated Graph Neural Network to exploit the appearance of each object as well as the global context of all present objects in the scene. In our experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms other approaches that are evaluated on the dataset like classification or ranking approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"What,Object,Should,I,Use?,-,Task,Driven,Object,Detection"
340,Triangulation Learning Network: From Monocular to Stereo 3D Object Detection,"In this paper, we study the problem of 3D object detection from stereo images, in which the key challenge is how to effectively utilize stereo information. Different from previous methods using pixel-level depth maps, we propose to employ 3D anchors to explicitly construct object-level correspondences between the regions of interest in stereo images, from which the deep neural network learns to detect and triangulate the targeted object in 3D space. We also introduce a cost-efficient channel reweighting strategy that enhances representational features and weakens noisy signals to facilitate the learning process. All of these are flexibly integrated into a solid baseline detector that inputs monocular images. We demonstrate that both the monocular baseline and the stereo triangulation learning network outperform the prior state-of-the-arts in 3D object detection and localization on the challenging KITTI dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Triangulation,Learning,Network:,From,Monocular,to,Stereo,3D,Object,Detection"
341,Connecting the Dots: Learning Representations for Active Monocular Depth Estimation,"We propose a technique for depth estimation with a monocular structured-light camera, i.e., a calibrated stereo set-up with one camera and one laser projector. Instead of formulating the depth estimation via a correspondence search problem, we show that a simple convolutional architecture is sufficient for high-quality disparity estimates in this setting. As accurate ground-truth is hard to obtain, we train our model in a self-supervised fashion with a combination of photometric and geometric losses. Further, we demonstrate that the projected pattern of the structured light sensor can be reliably separated from the ambient information. This can then be used to improve depth boundaries in a weakly supervised fashion by modeling the joint statistics of image and depth edges. The model trained in this fashion compares favorably to the state-of-the-art on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets. In addition, we contribute a novel simulator, which allows to benchmark active depth prediction algorithms in controlled conditions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Connecting,the,Dots:,Learning,Representations,for,Active,Monocular,Depth,Estimation"
342,Learning Non-Volumetric Depth Fusion Using Successive Reprojections,"Given a set of input views, multi-view stereopsis techniques estimate depth maps to represent the 3D reconstruction of the scene; these are fused into a single, consistent, reconstruction -- most often a point cloud. In this work we propose to learn an auto-regressive depth refinement directly from data. While deep learning has improved the accuracy and speed of depth estimation significantly, learned MVS techniques remain limited to the planesweeping paradigm. We refine a set of input depth maps by successively reprojecting information from neighbouring views to leverage multi-view constraints. Compared to learning-based volumetric fusion techniques, an image-based representation allows significantly more detailed reconstructions; compared to traditional point-based techniques, our method learns noise suppression and surface completion in a data-driven fashion. Due to the limited availability of high-quality reconstruction datasets with ground truth, we introduce two novel synthetic datasets to (pre-)train our network. Our approach is able to improve both the output depth maps and the reconstructed point cloud, for both learned and traditional depth estimation front-ends, on both synthetic and real data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Non-Volumetric,Depth,Fusion,Using,Successive,Reprojections"
343,Stereo R-CNN Based 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving,"We propose a 3D object detection method for autonomous driving by fully exploiting the sparse and dense, semantic and geometry information in stereo imagery. Our method, called Stereo R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN for stereo inputs to simultaneously detect and associate object in left and right images. We add extra branches after stereo Region Proposal Network (RPN) to predict sparse keypoints, viewpoints, and object dimensions, which are combined with 2D left-right boxes to calculate a coarse 3D object bounding box. We then recover the accurate 3D bounding box by a region-based photometric alignment using left and right RoIs. Our method does not require depth input and 3D position supervision, however, outperforms all existing fully supervised image-based methods. Experiments on the challenging KITTI dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art stereo-based method by around 30% AP on both 3D detection and 3D localization tasks. Code will be made publicly available.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Stereo,R-CNN,Based,3D,Object,Detection,for,Autonomous,Driving"
344,Hybrid Scene Compression for Visual Localization,"Localizing an image w.r.t. a 3D scene model represents a core task for many computer vision applications. An increasing number of real-world applications of visual localization on mobile devices, e.g., Augmented Reality or autonomous robots such as drones or self-driving cars, demand localization approaches to minimize storage and bandwidth requirements. Compressing the 3D models used for localization thus becomes a practical necessity. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid compression algorithm that uses a given memory limit in a more effective way. Rather than treating all 3D points equally, it represents a small set of points with full appearance information and an additional, larger set of points with compressed information. This enables our approach to obtain a more complete scene representation without increasing the memory requirements, leading to a superior performance compared to previous compression schemes. As part of our contribution, we show how to handle ambiguous matches arising from point compression during RANSAC. Besides outperforming previous  compression techniques in terms of pose accuracy under the same memory constraints, our compression scheme itself is also more efficient. Furthermore, the localization rates and accuracy obtained with our approach are comparable to state-of-the-art feature-based methods, while using a small fraction of the memory.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hybrid,Scene,Compression,for,Visual,Localization"
345,MMFace: A Multi-Metric Regression Network for Unconstrained Face Reconstruction,"We propose to address the face reconstruction in the wild by using a multi-metric regression network, MMFace, to align a 3D face morphable model (3DMM) to an input image. The key idea is to utilize a volumetric sub-network to estimate an intermediate geometry representation, and a parametric sub-network to regress the 3DMM parameters. Our parametric sub-network consists of identity loss, expression loss, and pose loss which greatly improves the aligned geometry details by incorporating high level loss functions directly defined in the 3DMM parametric spaces. Our high-quality reconstruction is robust under large variations of expressions, poses, illumination conditions, and even with large partial occlusions. We evaluate our method by comparing the performance with state-of-the-art approaches on latest 3D face dataset LS3D-W and Florence. We achieve significant improvements both quantitatively and qualitatively. Due to our high-quality reconstruction, our method can be easily extended to generate high-quality geometry sequences for video inputs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MMFace:,A,Multi-Metric,Regression,Network,for,Unconstrained,Face,Reconstruction"

Accurate future video prediction inherently requires understanding of 3D motion and geometry of a scene. In this paper, we propose a RGBD scene forecasting model with 3D motion decomposition. We predict ego-motion and foreground motion that are combined to generate a future 3D dynamic scene, which is then projected into a 2D image plane to synthesize future motion, RGB images and depth maps. Optional semantic maps can be integrated. Experimental results on KITTI and Driving datasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the- arts in forecasting future RGBD dynamic scenes.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"3D,Motion,Decomposition,for,RGBD,Future,Dynamic,Scene,Synthesis"
347,Single Image Depth Estimation Trained via Depth From Defocus Cues,"Estimating depth from a single RGB images is a fundamental task in computer vision, which is most directly solved using supervised deep learning. In the field of unsupervised learning of depth from a single RGB image, depth is not given explicitly. Existing work in the field receives either a stereo pair, a monocular video, or multiple views, and, using losses that are based on structure-from-motion, trains a depth estimation network. In this work, we rely, instead of different views, on depth from focus cues. Learning is based on a novel Point Spread Function convolutional layer, which applies location specific kernels that arise from the Circle-Of-Confusion in each image location. We evaluate our method on data derived from five common datasets for depth estimation and lightfield images, and present results that are on par with supervised methods on KITTI and Make3D datasets and outperform unsupervised learning approaches. Since the phenomenon of depth from defocus is not dataset specific, we hypothesize that learning based on it would overfit less to the specific content in each dataset. Our experiments show that this is indeed the case, and an estimator learned on one dataset using our method provides better results on other datasets, than the directly supervised methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Single,Image,Depth,Estimation,Trained,via,Depth,From,Defocus,Cues"
348,RGBD Based Dimensional Decomposition Residual Network for 3D Semantic Scene Completion,"RGB images differentiate from depth as they carry more details about the color and texture information, which can be utilized as a vital complement to depth for boosting the performance of 3D semantic scene completion (SSC). SSC is composed of 3D shape completion (SC) and semantic scene labeling while most of the existing approaches use depth as the sole input which causes the performance bottleneck. Moreover, the state-of-the-art methods employ 3D CNNs which have cumbersome networks and tremendous parameters. We introduce a light-weight Dimensional Decomposition Residual network (DDR) for 3D dense prediction tasks. The novel factorized convolution layer is effective for reducing the network parameters, and the proposed multi-scale fusion mechanism for depth and color image can improve the completion and segmentation accuracy simultaneously. Our method demonstrates excellent performance on two public datasets. Compared with the latest method SSCNet, we achieve 5.9% gains in SC-IoU and 5.7% gains in SSC-IOU, albeit with only 21% network parameters and 16.6% FLOPs employed compared with that of SSCNet.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"RGBD,Based,Dimensional,Decomposition,Residual,Network,for,3D,Semantic,Scene,Completion"
349,Neural Scene Decomposition for Multi-Person Motion Capture,"Learning general image representations has proven key to the success of many computer vision tasks. For example, many approaches to image understanding problems rely on deep networks that were initially trained on ImageNet, mostly because the learned features are a valuable starting point to learn from limited labeled data. However, when it comes to 3D motion capture of multiple people, these features are only of limited use.   In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to learning features that are useful for this purpose. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learning what we call a neural scene decomposition (NSD) that can be exploited for 3D pose estimation. NSD  comprises three layers of abstraction to represent human subjects: spatial layout in terms of bounding-boxes and relative depth; a 2D shape representation in terms of an instance segmentation mask; and subject-specific appearance and 3D pose information. By exploiting self-supervision coming from multiview data, our NSD model can be trained end-to-end without any 2D or 3D supervision. In contrast to previous approaches, it works for multiple persons and full-frame images. Because it encodes 3D geometry, NSD can then be effectively leveraged to train a 3D pose estimation network from small amounts of annotated data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Neural,Scene,Decomposition,for,Multi-Person,Motion,Capture"
350,Efficient Decision-Based Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition,"Face recognition has obtained remarkable progress in recent years due to the great improvement of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, deep CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can cause fateful consequences in real-world face recognition applications with security-sensitive purposes. Adversarial attacks are widely studied as they can identify the vulnerability of the models before they are deployed. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art face recognition models in the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but can only acquire hard-label predictions by sending queries to the target model. This attack setting is more practical in real-world face recognition systems. To improve the efficiency of previous methods, we propose an evolutionary attack algorithm, which can model the local geometry of the search directions and reduce the dimension of the search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that induces a minimum perturbation to an input face image with fewer queries. We also apply the proposed method to attack a real-world face recognition system successfully.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Efficient,Decision-Based,Black-Box,Adversarial,Attacks,on,Face,Recognition"

Instead of classifying anchor boxes using features from a pixel in the convolutional feature map, we adopt a pooling-based approach for generating region proposals. However, pooling hundreds of thousands of anchors which are evaluated for generating proposals becomes a computational bottleneck during inference. To this end, an efficient anchor placement strategy for reducing the number of anchor-boxes is proposed. We then show that proposals generated by our network (Floating Anchor Region Proposal Network, FA-RPN) are better than RPN for generating region proposals for face detection. We discuss several beneficial features of FA-RPN proposals (which can be enabled without re-training) like iterative refinement, placement of fractional anchors and changing size/shape of anchors. Our face detector based on FA-RPN obtains 89.4% mAP with a ResNet-50 backbone on the WIDER dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"FA-RPN:,Floating,Region,Proposals,for,Face,Detection"
352,Bayesian Hierarchical Dynamic Model for Human Action Recognition,"Human action recognition remains as a challenging task partially due to the presence of large variations in the execution of action. To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic model called Hierarchical Dynamic Model (HDM). Leveraging on Bayesian framework, the model parameters are allowed to vary across different sequences of data, which increase the capacity of the model to adapt to intra-class variations on both spatial and temporal extent of actions. Meanwhile, the generative learning process allows the model to preserve the distinctive dynamic pattern for each action class. Through Bayesian inference, we are able to quantify the uncertainty of the classification, providing insight during the decision process. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method not only achieves competitive recognition performance within individual dataset but also shows better generalization capability across different datasets. Experiments conducted on data with missing values also show the robustness of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bayesian,Hierarchical,Dynamic,Model,for,Human,Action,Recognition"
353,Mixed Effects Neural Networks (MeNets) With Applications to Gaze Estimation,"There is much interest in computer vision to utilize commodity hardware for gaze estimation. A number of papers have shown that algorithms based on deep convolutional architectures are approaching accuracies where streaming data from mass-market devices can offer good gaze tracking performance, although a gap still remains between what is possible and the performance users will expect in real deployments. We observe that one obvious avenue for improvement relates to a gap between some basic technical assumptions behind most existing approaches and the statistical properties of the data used for training. Specifically, most training datasets involve tens of users with a few hundreds (or more) repeated acquisitions per user. The non i.i.d. nature of this data suggests better estimation may be possible if the model explicitly made use of such ""repeated measurements"" from each user as is commonly done in classical statistical analysis using so-called mixed effects models. The goal of this paper is to adapt these ""mixed effects"" ideas from statistics within a deep neural network architecture for gaze estimation, based on eye images. Such a formulation seeks to specifically utilize information regarding the hierarchical structure of the training data -- each node in the hierarchy is a user who provides tens or hundreds of repeated samples. This modification yields an architecture that offers state of the art performance on various publicly available datasets improving results by 10-20%.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mixed,Effects,Neural,Networks,(MeNets),With,Applications,to,Gaze,Estimation"

We also introduce back-projection, a simple and effective semi-supervised training method that leverages unlabeled video data. We start with predicted 2D keypoints for unlabeled video, then estimate 3D poses and finally back-project to the input 2D keypoints. In the supervised setting, our fully-convolutional model outperforms the previous best result from the literature by 6 mm mean per-joint position error on Human3.6M, corresponding to an error reduction of 11%, and the model also shows significant improvements on HumanEva-I.

355,Learning to Regress 3D Face Shape and Expression From an Image Without 3D Supervision,"The estimation of 3D face shape from a single image must be robust to variations in lighting, head pose, expression, facial hair, makeup, and occlusions. Robustness requires a large training set of in-the-wild images, which by construction, lack ground truth 3D shape. To train a network without any 2D-to-3D supervision, we present RingNet, which learns to compute 3D face shape from a single image. Our key observation is that an individual's face shape is constant across images, regardless of expression, pose, lighting, etc. RingNet leverages multiple images of a person and automatically detected 2D face features. It uses a novel loss that encourages the face shape to be similar when the identity is the same and different for different people. We achieve invariance to expression by representing the face using the FLAME model. Once trained, our method takes a single image and outputs the parameters of FLAME, which can be readily animated. Additionally we create a new database of faces ""not quite in-the-wild"" (NoW) with 3D head scans and high-resolution images of the subjects in a wide variety of conditions. We evaluate publicly available methods and find that RingNet is more accurate than methods that use 3D supervision.

In this paper, we propose a human pose refinement network that estimates a refined pose from a tuple of an input image and input pose. The pose refinement was performed mainly through an end-to-end trainable multi-stage architecture in previous methods. However, they are highly dependent on pose estimation models and require careful model design. By contrast, we propose a model-agnostic pose refinement method. According to a recent study, state-of-the-art 2D human pose estimation methods have similar error distributions. We use this error statistics as prior information to generate synthetic poses and use the synthesized poses to train our model. In the testing stage, pose estimation results of any other methods can be input to the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed model does not require code or knowledge about other methods, which allows it to be easily used in the post-processing step. We show that the proposed approach achieves better performance than the conventional multi-stage refinement models and consistently improves the performance of various state-of-the-art pose estimation methods on the commonly used benchmark.

357,RepNet: Weakly Supervised Training of an Adversarial Reprojection Network for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose estimation from single images. While for a long time human skeletons were parameterized and fitted to the observation by satisfying a reprojection error, nowadays researchers directly use neural networks to infer the 3D pose from the observations. However, most of these approaches ignore the fact that a reprojection constraint has to be satisfied and are sensitive to overfitting. We tackle the overfitting problem by ignoring 2D to 3D correspondences. This efficiently avoids a simple memorization of the training data and allows for a weakly supervised training. One part of the proposed reprojection network (RepNet) learns a mapping from a distribution of 2D poses to a distribution of 3D poses using an adversarial training approach. Another part of the network estimates the camera. This allows for the definition of a network layer that performs the reprojection of the estimated 3D pose back to 2D which results in a reprojection loss function.   Our experiments show that RepNet generalizes well to unknown data and outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to unseen data.

358,Fast and Robust Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation From Multiple Views,"This paper addresses the problem of 3D pose estimation for multiple people in a few calibrated camera views. The main challenge of this problem is to find the cross-view correspondences among noisy and incomplete 2D pose predictions. Most previous methods address this challenge by directly reasoning in 3D using a pictorial structure model, which is inefficient due to the huge state space. We propose a fast and robust approach to solve this problem. Our key idea is to use a multi-way matching algorithm to cluster the detected 2D poses in all views. Each resulting cluster encodes 2D poses of the same person across different views and consistent correspondences across the keypoints, from which the 3D pose of each person can be effectively inferred. The proposed convex optimization based multi-way matching algorithm is efficient and robust against missing and false detections, without knowing the number of people in the scene. Moreover, we propose to combine geometric and appearance cues for cross-view matching. The proposed approach achieves significant performance gains from the state-of-the-art (96.3% vs. 90.6% and 96.9% vs. 88% on the Campus and Shelf datasets, respectively), while being efficient for real-time applications.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fast,and,Robust,Multi-Person,3D,Pose,Estimation,From,Multiple,Views"
359,Face-Focused Cross-Stream Network for Deception Detection in Videos,"Automated deception detection (ADD) from real-life videos is a challenging task. It specifically needs to address two problems:  (1) Both face and body contain useful cues regarding whether a subject is deceptive. How to effectively fuse the two is thus key to the effectiveness of an ADD model. (2) Real-life deceptive samples are hard to collect; learning with limited training data thus challenges most deep learning based ADD models. In this work, both problems are addressed. Specifically, for face-body multimodal learning, a novel face-focused cross-stream network (FFCSN) is proposed. It differs significantly from the popular two-stream networks in that: (a) face detection is added into the spatial stream to capture the facial expressions explicitly, and (b) correlation learning is performed across the spatial and temporal streams for joint deep feature learning across both face and body. To address the training data scarcity problem, our FFCSN model is trained with both meta learning and adversarial learning. Extensive experiments show that our FFCSN model achieves state-of-the-art results. Further, the proposed FFCSN model as well as its robust training strategy are shown to be generally applicable to other human-centric video analysis tasks such as emotion recognition from user-generated videos.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Face-Focused,Cross-Stream,Network,for,Deception,Detection,in,Videos"
360,Unequal-Training for Deep Face Recognition With Long-Tailed Noisy Data,"Large-scale face datasets usually exhibit a massive number of classes, a long-tailed distribution, and severe label noise, which undoubtedly aggravate the difficulty of training. In this paper, we propose a training strategy that treats the head data and the tail data in an unequal way, accompanying with noise-robust loss functions, to take full advantage of their respective characteristics. Specifically, the unequal-training framework provides two training data streams: the first stream applies the head data to learn discriminative face representation supervised by Noise Resistance loss; the second stream applies the tail data to learn auxiliary information by gradually mining the stable discriminative information from confusing tail classes. Consequently, both training streams offer complementary information to deep feature learning. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the new unequal-training framework and loss functions. Better yet, our method could save a significant amount of GPU memory. With our method, we achieve the best result on MegaFace Challenge 2 (MF2) given a large-scale noisy training data set.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unequal-Training,for,Deep,Face,Recognition,With,Long-Tailed,Noisy,Data"
361,T-Net: Parametrizing Fully Convolutional Nets With a Single High-Order Tensor,"Recent findings indicate that over-parametrization, while crucial for successfully training deep neural networks, also introduces large amounts of redundancy. Tensor methods have the potential to efficiently parametrize over-complete representations by leveraging this redundancy. In this paper, we propose to fully parametrize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a single high-order, low-rank tensor. Previous works on network tensorization have focused on parametrizing individual layers (convolutional or fully connected) only, and perform the tensorization layer-by-layer separately. In contrast, we propose to jointly capture the full structure of a neural network by parametrizing it with a single high-order tensor, the modes of which represent each of the architectural design parameters of the network (e.g. number of convolutional blocks, depth, number of stacks, input features, etc). This parametrization allows to regularize the whole network and drastically reduce the number of parameters. Our model is end-to-end trainable and the low-rank structure imposed on the weight tensor acts as an implicit regularization. We study the case of networks with rich structure, namely Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), which we propose to parametrize with a single 8th-order tensor. We show that our approach can achieve superior performance with small compression rates, and attain high compression rates with negligible drop in accuracy for the challenging task of human pose estimation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"T-Net:,Parametrizing,Fully,Convolutional,Nets,With,a,Single,High-Order,Tensor"
362,Hierarchical Cross-Modal Talking Face Generation With Dynamic Pixel-Wise Loss,"We devise a cascade GAN approach to generate talking face video, which is robust to different face shapes, view angles, facial characteristics, and noisy audio conditions. Instead of learning a direct mapping from audio to video frames, we propose first to transfer audio to high-level structure, i.e., the facial landmarks, and then to generate video frames conditioned on the landmarks. Compared to a direct audio-to-image approach, our cascade approach avoids fitting spurious correlations between audiovisual signals that are irrelevant to the speech content. We, humans, are sensitive to temporal discontinuities and subtle artifacts in video. To avoid those pixel jittering problems and to enforce the network to focus on audiovisual-correlated regions, we propose a novel dynamically adjustable pixel-wise loss with an attention mechanism. Furthermore, to generate a sharper image with well-synchronized facial movements, we propose a novel regression-based discriminator structure, which considers sequence-level information along with frame-level information. Thoughtful experiments on several datasets and real-world samples demonstrate significantly better results obtained by our method than the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hierarchical,Cross-Modal,Talking,Face,Generation,With,Dynamic,Pixel-Wise,Loss"
363,Object-Centric Auto-Encoders and Dummy Anomalies for Abnormal Event Detection in Video,"Abnormal event detection in video is a challenging vision problem. Most existing approaches formulate abnormal event detection as an outlier detection task, due to the scarcity of anomalous data during training. Because of the lack of prior information regarding abnormal events, these methods are not fully-equipped to differentiate between normal and abnormal events. In this work, we formalize abnormal event detection as a one-versus-rest binary classification problem. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce an unsupervised feature learning framework based on object-centric convolutional auto-encoders to encode both motion and appearance information. Second, we propose a supervised classification approach based on clustering the training samples into normality clusters. A one-versus-rest abnormal event classifier is then employed to separate each normality cluster from the rest. For the purpose of training the classifier, the other clusters act as dummy anomalies.

Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmarks: Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD and UMN. Our approach provides superior results on all four data sets.

364,DDLSTM: Dual-Domain LSTM for Cross-Dataset Action Recognition,"Domain alignment in convolutional networks aims to learn the degree of layer-specific feature alignment beneficial to the joint learning of source and target datasets. While increasingly popular in convolutional networks, there have been no previous attempts to achieve domain alignment in recurrent networks. Similar to spatial features, both source and target domains are likely to exhibit temporal dependencies that can be jointly learnt and aligned.  In this paper we introduce Dual-Domain LSTM (DDLSTM), an architecture that is able to learn temporal dependencies from two domains concurrently.  It performs cross-contaminated batch normalisation on both input-to-hidden and hidden-to-hidden weights, and learns the parameters for cross-contamination, for both single-layer and multi-layer LSTM architectures. We evaluate DDLSTM on frame-level action recognition using three datasets, taking a pair at a time, and report an average increase in accuracy of 3.5%. The proposed DDLSTM architecture outperforms standard, fine-tuned, and batch-normalised LSTMs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DDLSTM:,Dual-Domain,LSTM,for,Cross-Dataset,Action,Recognition"
365,The Pros and Cons: Rank-Aware Temporal Attention for Skill Determination in Long Videos,"We present a new model to determine relative skill from long videos, through learnable temporal attention modules. Skill determination is formulated as a ranking problem, making it suitable for common and generic tasks. However, for long videos, parts of the video are irrelevant for assessing skill, and there may be variability in the skill exhibited throughout a video. We therefore propose a method which assesses the relative overall level of skill in a long video by attending to its skill-relevant parts.  Our approach trains temporal attention modules, learned with only video-level supervision, using a novel rank-aware loss function. In addition to attending to task-relevant video parts, our proposed loss jointly trains two attention modules to separately attend to video parts which are indicative of higher (pros) and lower (cons) skill. We evaluate our approach on the EPIC-Skills dataset and additionally annotate a larger dataset from YouTube videos for skill determination with five previously unexplored tasks. Our method outperforms previous approaches and classic softmax attention on both datasets by over 4% pairwise accuracy, and as much as 12% on individual tasks. We also demonstrate our model's ability to attend to rank-aware parts of the video.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"The,Pros,and,Cons:,Rank-Aware,Temporal,Attention,for,Skill,Determination,in,Long,Videos"
366,Collaborative Spatiotemporal Feature Learning for Video Action Recognition,"Spatiotemporal feature learning is of central importance for action recognition in videos. Existing deep neural network models either learn spatial and temporal features independently (C2D) or jointly with unconstrained parameters (C3D). In this paper, we propose a novel neural operation which encodes spatiotemporal features collaboratively by imposing a weight-sharing constraint on the learnable parameters. In particular, we perform 2D convolution along three orthogonal views of volumetric video data, which learns spatial appearance and temporal motion cues respectively. By sharing the convolution kernels of different views, spatial and temporal features are collaboratively learned and thus benefit from each other. The complementary features are subsequently fused by a weighted summation whose coefficients are learned end-to-end. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks and won the 1st place in the Moments in Time Challenge 2018. Moreover, based on the learned coefficients of different views, we are able to quantify the contributions of spatial and temporal features. This analysis sheds light on interpretability of the model and may also guide the future design of algorithm for video recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Collaborative,Spatiotemporal,Feature,Learning,for,Video,Action,Recognition"
367,MARS: Motion-Augmented RGB Stream for Action Recognition,"Most state-of-the-art methods for action recognition consist of a two-stream architecture with 3D convolutions: an appearance stream for RGB frames and a motion stream for optical flow frames.  Although combining flow with RGB improves the performance, the cost of computing accurate optical flow is high, and increases action recognition latency. This limits the usage of two-stream approaches in real-world applications requiring low latency. In this paper, we introduce two learning approaches to train a standard 3D CNN, operating on RGB frames, that mimics the motion stream, and as a result avoids flow computation at test time.  First, by minimizing a feature-based loss compared to the Flow stream, we show that the network reproduces the motion stream with high fidelity.  Second, to leverage both appearance and motion information effectively, we train with a linear combination of the feature-based loss and the standard cross-entropy loss for action recognition. We denote the stream trained using this combined loss as Motion-Augmented RGB Stream (MARS). As a single stream, MARS performs better than RGB or Flow alone, for instance with 72.7% accuracy on Kinetics compared to 72.0% and 65.6% with RGB and Flow streams respectively.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MARS:,Motion-Augmented,RGB,Stream,for,Action,Recognition"

It learns to produce an intermediate spatial representation (activity map) based on individual and group activities. A multi-stage refinement component is responsible for decreasing the incorrect predictions in the activity map.    Finally, an aggregation component uses the refined information to recognize group activities. Experimental results demonstrate the constructive contribution of the information extracted and represented in the form of the activity map.

369,Video Summarization by Learning From Unpaired Data,"We consider the problem of video summarization. Given an input raw video, the goal is to select a small subset of key frames from the input video to create a shorter summary video that best describes the content of the original video. Most of the current state-of-the-art video summarization approaches use supervised learning and require labeled training data. Each training instance consists of a raw input video and its ground truth summary video curated by human annotators. However, it is very expensive and difficult to create such labeled training examples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel formulation to learn video summarization from unpaired data. We present an approach that learns to generate optimal video summaries using a set of raw videos (V) and a set of summary videos (S), where there exists no correspondence between V and S. We argue that this type of data is much easier to collect. Our model aims to learn a mapping function F : V -> S such that the distribution of resultant summary videos from F(V) is similar to the distribution of S with the help of an adversarial objective. In addition, we enforce a diversity constraint on F(V) to ensure that the generated video summaries are visually diverse. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other alternative methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Video,Summarization,by,Learning,From,Unpaired,Data"
370,Skeleton-Based Action Recognition With Directed Graph Neural Networks,"The skeleton data have been widely used for the action recognition tasks since they can robustly accommodate dynamic circumstances and complex backgrounds. In existing methods, both the joint and bone information in skeleton data have been proved to be of great help for action recognition tasks. However, how to incorporate these two types of data to best take advantage of the relationship between joints and bones remains a problem to be solved. In this work, we represent the skeleton data as a directed acyclic graph based on the kinematic dependency between the joints and bones in the natural human body. A novel directed graph neural network is designed specially to extract the information of joints, bones and their relations and make prediction based on the extracted features. In addition, to better fit the action recognition task, the topological structure of the graph is made adaptive based on the training process, which brings notable improvement. Moreover, the motion information of the skeleton sequence is exploited and combined with the spatial information to further enhance the performance in a two-stream framework. Our final model is tested on two large-scale datasets, NTU-RGBD and Skeleton-Kinetics, and exceeds state-of-the-art performance on both of them.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Skeleton-Based,Action,Recognition,With,Directed,Graph,Neural,Networks"
371,PA3D: Pose-Action 3D Machine for Video Recognition,"Recent studies have witnessed the successes of using 3D CNNs for video action recognition. However, most 3D models are built upon RGB and optical flow streams, which may not fully exploit pose dynamics, i.e., an important cue of modeling human actions. To fill this gap, we propose a concise Pose-Action 3D Machine (PA3D), which can effectively encode multiple pose modalities within a unified 3D framework, and consequently learn spatio-temporal pose representations for action recognition.  More specifically, we introduce a novel temporal pose convolution to aggregate spatial poses over frames. Unlike the classical temporal convolution, our operation can explicitly learn the pose motions that are discriminative to recognize human actions. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks (i.e., JHMDB, HMDB, and Charades) show that, PA3D outperforms the recent pose-based approaches. Furthermore, PA3D is highly complementary to the recent 3D CNNs, e.g., I3D.

In such a human-human interaction analysis problem, it is crucial to explore the relations between the camera wearer and the interactor. However, most existing works directly model the interactions as a whole and lack modeling the relations between the two interacting persons. To exploit the strong relations for egocentric interaction recognition, we introduce a dual relation modeling framework which learns to model the relations between the camera wearer and the interactor based on the individual action representations of the two persons. Specifically, we develop a novel interactive LSTM module, the key component of our framework, to explicitly model the relations between the two interacting persons based on their individual action representations, which are collaboratively learned with an interactor attention module and a global-local motion module. Experimental results on three egocentric interaction datasets show the effectiveness of our method and advantage over state-of-the-arts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Dual,Relation,Modeling,for,Egocentric,Interaction,Recognition"

Our new annotations comprise 65,213 pixel masks for 977 distinct objects (cars and pedestrians) in 10,870 video frames. For evaluation, we extend existing multi-object tracking metrics to this new task. Moreover, we propose a new baseline method which jointly addresses detection, tracking, and segmentation with a single convolutional network. We demonstrate the value of our datasets by achieving improvements in performance when training on MOTS annotations. We believe that our datasets, metrics and baseline will become a valuable resource towards developing multi-object tracking approaches that go beyond 2D bounding boxes.

374,Siamese Cascaded Region Proposal Networks for Real-Time Visual Tracking,"Recently, the region proposal networks (RPN) have been combined with the Siamese network for tracking, and shown excellent accuracy with high efficiency. Nevertheless, previously proposed one-stage Siamese-RPN trackers degenerate in presence of similar distractors and large scale variation. Addressing these issues, we propose a multi-stage tracking framework, Siamese Cascaded RPN (C-RPN), which consists of a sequence of RPNs cascaded from deep high-level to shallow low-level layers in a Siamese network. Compared to previous solutions, C-RPN has several advantages: (1) Each RPN is trained using the outputs of RPN in the previous stage. Such process stimulates hard negative sampling, resulting in more balanced training samples. Consequently, the RPNs are sequentially more discriminative in distinguishing difficult background (i.e.,, similar distractors). (2) Multi-level features are fully leveraged through a novel feature transfer block (FTB) for each RPN, further improving the discriminability of C-RPN using both high-level semantic and low-level spatial information. (3) With multiple steps of regressions, C-RPN progressively refines the location and shape of the target in each RPN with adjusted anchor boxes in the previous stage, which makes localization more accurate. C-RPN is trained end-to-end with the multi-task loss function. In inference, C-RPN is deployed as it is, without any temporal adaption, for real-time tracking. In extensive experiments on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, VOT-2016, VOT-2017, LaSOT and TrackingNet, C-RPN consistently achieves state-of-the-art results and runs in real-time.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Siamese,Cascaded,Region,Proposal,Networks,for,Real-Time,Visual,Tracking"
375,PointFlowNet: Learning Representations for Rigid Motion Estimation From Point Clouds,"Despite significant progress in image-based 3D scene flow estimation, the performance of such approaches has not yet reached the fidelity required by many applications. Simultaneously, these applications are often not restricted to image-based estimation: laser scanners provide a popular alternative to traditional cameras, for example in the context of self-driving cars, as they directly yield a 3D point cloud. In this paper, we propose to estimate 3D motion from such unstructured point clouds using a deep neural network. In a single forward pass, our model jointly predicts 3D scene flow as well as the 3D bounding box and rigid body motion of objects in the scene. While the prospect of estimating 3D scene flow from unstructured point clouds is  promising, it is also a challenging task. We show that the traditional global representation of rigid body motion prohibits inference by CNNs, and propose a translation equivariant representation to circumvent this problem. For training our deep network, a large dataset is required. Because of this, we augment real scans from KITTI with virtual objects, realistically modeling occlusions and simulating sensor noise. A thorough comparison with classic and learning-based techniques highlights the robustness of the proposed approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"PointFlowNet:,Learning,Representations,for,Rigid,Motion,Estimation,From,Point,Clouds"
376,Listen to the Image,"Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution devices can assist the blind in sensing the visual environment by translating the visual information into a sound pattern. To improve the translation quality, the task performances of the blind are usually employed to evaluate different encoding schemes. In contrast to the toilsome human-based assessment, we argue that machine model can be also developed for evaluation, and more efficient. To this end, we firstly propose two distinct cross-modal perception model w.r.t. the late-blind and congenitally-blind cases, which aim to generate concrete visual contents based on the translated sound. To validate the functionality of proposed models, two novel optimization strategies w.r.t. the primary encoding scheme are presented. Further, we conduct sets of human-based experiments to evaluate and compare them with the conducted machine-based assessments in the cross-modal generation task. Their highly consistent results w.r.t. different encoding schemes indicate that using machine model to accelerate optimization evaluation and reduce experimental cost is feasible to some extent, which could dramatically promote the upgrading of encoding scheme then help the blind to improve their visual perception ability.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Listen,to,the,Image"
377,Image Super-Resolution by Neural Texture Transfer,"Due to the significant information loss in low-resolution (LR) images, it has become extremely challenging to further advance the state-of-the-art of single image super-resolution (SISR). Reference-based super-resolution (RefSR), on the other hand, has proven to be promising in recovering high-resolution (HR) details when a reference (Ref) image with similar content as that of the LR input is given. However, the quality of RefSR can degrade severely when Ref is less similar. This paper aims to unleash the potential of RefSR by leveraging more texture details from Ref images with stronger robustness even when irrelevant Ref images are provided. Inspired by the recent work on image stylization, we formulate the RefSR problem as neural texture transfer. We design an end-to-end deep model which enriches HR details by adaptively transferring the texture from Ref images according to their textural similarity. Instead of matching content in the raw pixel space as done by previous methods, our key contribution is a multi-level matching conducted in the neural space. This matching scheme facilitates multi-scale neural transfer that allows the model to benefit more from those semantically related Ref patches, and gracefully degrade to SISR performance on the least relevant Ref inputs. We build a benchmark dataset for the general research of RefSR, which contains Ref images paired with LR inputs with varying levels of similarity. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Image,Super-Resolution,by,Neural,Texture,Transfer"
378,Conditional Adversarial Generative Flow for Controllable Image Synthesis,"Flow-based generative models show great potential in image synthesis due to its reversible pipeline and exact log-likelihood target, yet it suffers from weak ability for conditional image synthesis, especially for multi-label or unaware conditions. This is because the potential distribution of image conditions is hard to measure precisely from its latent variable z. In this paper, based on modeling a joint probabilistic density of an image and its conditions, we propose a novel flow-based generative model named conditional adversarial generative flow (CAGlow). Instead of disentangling attributes from latent space, we blaze a new trail for learning an encoder to estimate the mapping from condition space to latent space in an adversarial manner. Given a specific condition c, CAGlow can encode it to a sampled z, and then enable robust conditional image synthesis in complex situations like combining person identity with multiple attributes. The proposed CAGlow can be implemented in both supervised and unsupervised manners, thus can synthesize images with conditional information like categories, attributes, and even some unknown properties. Extensive experiments show that CAGlow ensures the independence of different conditions and outperforms regular Glow to a significant extent.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Conditional,Adversarial,Generative,Flow,for,Controllable,Image,Synthesis"
379,How to Make a Pizza: Learning a Compositional Layer-Based GAN Model,"A food recipe is an ordered set of instructions for preparing a particular dish. From a visual perspective, every instruction step can be seen as a way to change the visual appearance of the dish by adding extra objects (e.g., adding an ingredient) or changing the appearance of the existing ones (e.g., cooking the dish). In this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by building a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure. To do so, we learn composable module operations which are able to either add or remove a particular ingredient. Each operator is designed as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Given only weak image-level supervision, the operators are trained to generate a visual layer that needs to be added to or removed from the existing image. The proposed model is able to decompose an image into an ordered sequence of layers by applying sequentially in the right order the corresponding removing modules. Experimental results on synthetic and real pizza images demonstrate that our proposed model is able to: (1) segment pizza toppings in a weakly- supervised fashion, (2) remove them by revealing what is occluded underneath them (i.e., inpainting), and (3) infer the ordering of the toppings without any depth ordering supervision.

380,TransGaGa: Geometry-Aware Unsupervised Image-To-Image Translation,"Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims at learning a mapping between two visual domains. However, learning a translation across large geometry variations al- ways ends up with failure. In this work, we present a novel disentangle-and-translate framework to tackle the complex objects image-to-image translation task. Instead of learning the mapping on the image space directly, we disentangle image space into a Cartesian product of the appearance and the geometry latent spaces. Specifically, we first in- troduce a geometry prior loss and a conditional VAE loss to encourage the network to learn independent but com- plementary representations. The translation is then built on appearance and geometry space separately. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method to other state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the challenging near-rigid and non-rigid objects translation tasks. In addition, by taking different exemplars as the ap- pearance references, our method also supports multimodal translation.

Existing methods and datasets for rain removal, however, ignore these physical properties, thereby limiting the rain removal efficiency on real photos. In this work, we first analyze the visual effects of rain subject to scene depth and formulate a rain imaging model collectively with rain streaks and fog; by then, we prepare a new dataset called RainCityscapes with rain streaks and fog on real outdoor photos. Furthermore, we design an end-to-end deep neural network, where we train it to learn depth-attentional features via a depth-guided attention mechanism, and regress a residual map to produce the rain-free image output.

382,Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction Using a Deep Spatial-Spectral Prior,"Regularization is a fundamental technique to solve an ill-posed optimization problem robustly and is essential to reconstruct compressive hyperspectral images. Various hand-crafted priors have been employed as a regularizer but are often insufficient to handle the wide variety of spectra of natural hyperspectral images, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. Moreover, the prior-regularized optimization requires manual tweaking of its weight parameters to achieve a balance between the spatial and spectral fidelity of result images. In this paper, we present a novel hyperspectral image reconstruction algorithm that substitutes the traditional hand-crafted prior with a data-driven prior, based on an optimization-inspired network. Our method consists of two main parts: First, we learn a novel data-driven prior that regularizes the optimization problem with a goal to boost the spatial-spectral fidelity. Our data-driven prior learns both local coherence and dynamic characteristics of natural hyperspectral images. Second, we combine our regularizer with an optimization-inspired network to overcome the heavy computation problem in the traditional iterative optimization methods. We learn the complete parameters in the network through end-to-end training, enabling robust performance with high accuracy. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments validate the superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hyperspectral,Image,Reconstruction,Using,a,Deep,Spatial-Spectral,Prior"

Unfortunately these fail in the presence of challenging light transport effects including partial occlusion, low contrast, and reflective or refractive surfaces. Building on spatio-angular imaging modalities offered by emerging light field cameras, we introduce a new and computationally efficient 4D light field feature detector and descriptor: LiFF. LiFF is scale invariant and utilizes the full 4D light field to detect features that are robust to changes in perspective. This is particularly useful for structure from motion (SfM) and other tasks that match features across viewpoints of a scene. We demonstrate significantly improved 3D reconstructions via SfM when using LiFF instead of the leading 2D or 4D features, and show that LiFF runs an order of magnitude faster than the leading 4D approach. Finally, LiFF inherently estimates depth for each feature, opening a path for future research in light field-based SfM.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LiFF:,Light,Field,Features,in,Scale,and,Depth"

To address this issue, we introduce a recurrent framework that unifies the semantic correspondence and color propagation steps. Both steps allow a provided reference image to guide the colorization of every frame, thus reducing accumulated propagation errors. Video frames are colorized in sequence based on the colorization history, and its coherency is further enforced by the temporal consistency loss. All of these components, learned end-to-end, help produce realistic videos with good temporal stability.

UnOS significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) unsupervised approaches that treated the two tasks independently. Specifically, given two consecutive stereo image pairs from a video, UnOS estimates per-pixel stereo depth images, camera ego-motion and optical flow with three parallel CNNs. Based on these quantities, UnOS computes rigid optical flow and compares it against the optical flow estimated from the FlowNet, yielding pixels satisfying the rigid-scene assumption. Then, we encourage geometrical consistency between the two estimated flows within rigid regions, from which we derive a rigid-aware direct visual odometry (RDVO) module. We also propose rigid and occlusion-aware flow-consistency losses for the learning of UnOS. We evaluated our results on the popular KITTI dataset over 4 related tasks, i.e. stereo depth, optical flow, visual odometry and motion segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"UnOS:,Unified,Unsupervised,Optical-Flow,and,Stereo-Depth,Estimation,by,Watching,Videos"
387,Learning Transformation Synchronization,"Reconstructing the 3D model of a physical object typically requires us to align the depth scans obtained from different camera poses into the same coordinate system. Solutions to this global alignment problem usually proceed in two steps. The first step estimates relative transformations between pairs of scans using an off-the-shelf technique. Due to limited information presented between pairs of scans, the resulting relative transformations are generally noisy. The second step then jointly optimizes the relative transformations among all input depth scans. A natural constraint used in this step is the cycle-consistency constraint, which allows us to prune incorrect relative transformations by detecting inconsistent cycles. The performance of such approaches, however, heavily relies on the quality of the input relative transformations. Instead of merely using the relative transformations as the input to perform transformation synchronization, we propose to use a neural network to learn the weights associated with each relative transformation. Our approach alternates between transformation synchronization using weighted relative transformations and predicting new weights of the input relative transformations using a neural network. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach across a wide range of datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Transformation,Synchronization"

By postponing the detection to a later stage, the obtained keypoints are more stable than their traditional counterparts based on early detection of low-level structures. We show that this model can be trained using pixel correspondences extracted from readily available large-scale SfM reconstructions, without any further annotations.

Recent state-of-the-art video deblurring methods bank on convolutional recurrent neural network architectures to exploit the temporal relationship between neighboring frames. In this work, we aim to improve the accuracy of recurrent models by adapting the hidden states transferred from past frames to the frame being processed so that the relations between video frames could be better used. We iteratively update the hidden state via re-using RNN cell parameters before predicting an output deblurred frame. Since we use existing parameters to update the hidden state, our method improves accuracy without additional modules. As the architecture remains the same regardless of iteration number, fewer iteration models can be considered as a partial computational path of the models with more iterations. To take advantage of this property, we employ a stochastic method to optimize our iterative models better. At training time, we randomly choose the iteration number on the fly and apply a regularization loss that favors less computation unless there are considerable reconstruction gains. We show that our method exhibits state-of-the-art video deblurring performance while operating in real-time speed.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Recurrent,Neural,Networks,With,Intra-Frame,Iterations,for,Video,Deblurring"

We propose a data-driven approach, where the training data is captured with a high frame rate camera and blurry images are simulated through an averaging process.  While it is possible to train a neural network to recover the sharp frames from their average, there is no guarantee of the temporal smoothness for the formed video, as the frames are estimated independently. To address the temporal smoothness requirement we propose a system with two networks: One, DeblurNet, to predict sharp keyframes  and the second, InterpNet, to predict intermediate frames between the generated keyframes. A smooth transition is ensured by interpolating between consecutive keyframes using InterpNet.  Moreover, the proposed scheme enables further increase in frame rate without retraining the network, by applying InterpNet recursively between pairs of sharp frames. We evaluate the proposed method on several datasets, including a novel dataset captured with a Sony RX V camera. We also demonstrate its performance of increasing the frame rate up to 20 times on real blurry videos.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Extract,Flawless,Slow,Motion,From,Blurry,Videos"
391,Natural and Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution With Explicit Natural Manifold Discrimination,"Recently, many convolutional neural networks for single image super-resolution (SISR) have been proposed, which focus on reconstructing the high-resolution images in terms of objective distortion measures. However, the networks trained with objective loss functions generally fail to reconstruct the realistic fine textures and details that are essential for better perceptual quality. Recovering the realistic details remains a challenging problem, and only a few works have been proposed which aim at increasing the perceptual quality by generating enhanced textures. However, the generated fake details often make undesirable artifacts and the overall image looks somewhat unnatural. Therefore, in this paper, we present a new approach to reconstructing realistic super-resolved images with high perceptual quality, while maintaining the naturalness of the result. In particular, we focus on the domain prior properties of SISR problem. Specifically, we define the naturalness prior in the low-level domain and constrain the output image in the natural manifold, which eventually generates more natural and realistic images. Our results show better naturalness compared to the recent super-resolution algorithms including perception-oriented ones.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Natural,and,Realistic,Single,Image,Super-Resolution,With,Explicit,Natural,Manifold,Discrimination"
392,RF-Net: An End-To-End Image Matching Network Based on Receptive Field,"This paper proposes a new end-to-end trainable matching network based on receptive field, RF-Net, to compute sparse correspondence between images. Building end-to-end trainable matching framework is desirable and challenging. The very recent approach, LF-Net, successfully embeds the entire feature extraction pipeline into a jointly trainable pipeline, and produces the state-of-the-art matching results. This paper introduces two modifications to the structure of LF-Net. First, we propose to construct receptive feature maps, which lead to more effective keypoint detection. Second, we introduce a general loss function term, neighbor mask, to facilitate training patch selection. This results in improved stability in descriptor training. We trained RF-Net on the open dataset HPatches, and compared it with other methods on multiple benchmark datasets. Experiments show that RF-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"RF-Net:,An,End-To-End,Image,Matching,Network,Based,on,Receptive,Field"
393,Fast Single Image Reflection Suppression via Convex Optimization,"Removing undesired reflections from images taken through the glass is of great importance in computer vision. It serves as a means to enhance the image quality for aesthetic purposes as well as to preprocess images in machine learning and pattern recognition applications. We propose a convex model to suppress the reflection from a single input image. Our model implies a partial differential equation with gradient thresholding, which is solved efficiently using Discrete Cosine Transform. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that our approach achieves desirable reflection suppression results and dramatically reduces the execution time compared to the state of the art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fast,Single,Image,Reflection,Suppression,via,Convex,Optimization"
394,A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection With Intertwined Multi-Supervision,"Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to preciser foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Mutual,Learning,Method,for,Salient,Object,Detection,With,Intertwined,Multi-Supervision"
395,Enhanced Pix2pix Dehazing Network,"In this paper,  we reduce the image dehazing problem to an image-to-image translation problem, and propose  Enhanced Pix2pix Dehazing Network (EPDN),  which generates a haze-free image without relying on the physical scattering model.  EPDN is embedded by a generative adversarial network,  which is followed by a well-designed enhancer.  Inspired by visual perception global-first theory,  the discriminator guides the generator to create a pseudo realistic image on a coarse scale,  while the enhancer following the generator is required to produce a realistic dehazing image on the fine scale.  The enhancer contains two enhancing blocks based on the receptive field model,  which reinforces the dehazing effect in both color and details. The embedded GAN is jointly trained with the enhancer. Extensive experiment results on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets show that the proposed EPDN is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR,  SSIM,   PI, and subjective visual effect.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Enhanced,Pix2pix,Dehazing,Network"

However, most of the research in the prior art has focused on finding the optimal method for an average user. Since there is large deviation in personal opinions and aesthetic standards, the next challenge is to find the settings and post-processing techniques that fit to the individual users' personal taste. In this study, we aim to predict the personally perceived image quality by combining classical image feature analysis and collaboration filtering approach known from the recommendation systems. The experimental results for the proposed method show promising results. As a practical application, our work can be used for personalizing the camera settings or post-processing parameters for different users and images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Assessing,Personally,Perceived,Image,Quality,via,Image,Features,and,Collaborative,Filtering"
397,Single Image Reflection Removal Exploiting Misaligned Training Data and Network Enhancements,"Removing undesirable reflections from a single image captured through a glass window is of practical importance to visual computing systems. Although state-of-the-art methods can obtain decent results in certain situations, performance declines significantly when tackling more general real-world cases.  These failures stem from the intrinsic difficulty of single image reflection removal -- the fundamental ill-posedness of the problem, and the insufficiency of densely-labeled training data needed for resolving this ambiguity within learning-based neural network pipelines. In this paper, we address these issues by exploiting targeted network enhancements and the novel use of misaligned data. For the former, we augment a baseline network architecture by embedding context encoding modules that are capable of leveraging high-level contextual clues to reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong reflections. For the latter, we introduce an alignment-invariant loss function that facilitates exploiting misaligned real-world training data that is much easier to collect.  Experimental results collectively show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with aligned data, and that significant improvements are possible when using additional misaligned data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Single,Image,Reflection,Removal,Exploiting,Misaligned,Training,Data,and,Network,Enhancements"
398,Exploring Context and Visual Pattern of Relationship for Scene Graph Generation,"Relationship is the core of scene graph, but its prediction is far from satisfying because of its complex visual diversity. To alleviate this problem, we treat relationship as an abstract object, exploring not only significative visual pattern but contextual information for it, which are two key aspects when considering object recognition. Our observation on current datasets reveals that there exists intimate association among relationships. Therefore, inspired by the successful application of context to object-oriented tasks, we especially construct context for relationships where all of them are gathered so that the recognition could benefit from their association. Moreover, accurate recognition needs discriminative visual pattern for object, and so does relationship. In order to discover effective pattern for relationship, traditional relationship feature extraction methods such as using union region or combination of subject-object feature pairs are replaced with our proposed intersection region which focuses on more essential parts. Therefore, we present our so-called Relationship Context - InterSeCtion Region (CISC) method. Experiments for scene graph generation on Visual Genome dataset and visual relationship prediction on VRD dataset indicate that both the relationship context and intersection region improve performances and realize anticipated functions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Exploring,Context,and,Visual,Pattern,of,Relationship,for,Scene,Graph,Generation"
399,Learning From Synthetic Data for Crowd Counting in the Wild,"Recently, counting the number of people for crowd scenes is a hot topic because of its widespread applications (e.g. video surveillance, public security). It is a difficult task in the wild: changeable environment, large-range number of people cause the current methods can not work well. In addition, due to the scarce data, many methods suffer from over-fitting to a different extent. To remedy the above two problems, firstly, we develop a data collector and labeler, which can generate the synthetic crowd scenes and simultaneously annotate them without any manpower. Based on it, we build a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset. Secondly, we propose two schemes that exploit the synthetic data to boost the performance of crowd counting in the wild: 1) pretrain a crowd counter on the synthetic data, then finetune it using the real data, which significantly prompts the model's performance on real data; 2) propose a crowd counting method via domain adaptation, which can free humans from heavy data annotations. Extensive experiments show that the first method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four real datasets, and the second outperforms our baselines.

400,A Local Block Coordinate Descent Algorithm for the CSC Model,"The Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) model has recently gained considerable traction in the signal and image processing communities. By providing a global, yet tractable, model that operates on the whole image, the CSC was shown to overcome several limitations of the patch-based sparse model while achieving superior performance in various applications. Contemporary methods for pursuit and learning the CSC dictionary often rely on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in the Fourier domain for the computational convenience of convolutions, while ignoring the local characterizations of the image. In this work we propose a new and simple approach that adopts a localized strategy, based on the Block Coordinate Descent algorithm. The proposed method, termed Local Block Coordinate Descent (LoBCoD), operates locally on image patches. Furthermore, we introduce a novel stochastic gradient descent version of LoBCoD for training the convolutional filters. This Stochastic-LoBCoD leverages the benefits of online learning, while being applicable even to a single training image. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms for image inpainting and multi-focus image fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Local,Block,Coordinate,Descent,Algorithm,for,the,CSC,Model"
401,Not Using the Car to See the Sidewalk -- Quantifying and Controlling the Effects of Context in Classification and Segmentation,"Importance of visual context in scene understanding tasks is well recognized  in the computer vision community. However, to what extent the computer vision models are dependent on the context to make their predictions is unclear. A model overly relying on context will fail when encountering objects in different contexts than in training data and hence it is important to identify these dependencies before we can deploy the models in the real-world. We propose a method to quantify the sensitivity of black-box vision models to visual context by editing images to remove selected objects and measuring the response of the target models. We apply this methodology on two tasks, image classification and semantic segmentation, and discover undesirable dependency between objects and context, for example that ""sidewalk"" segmentation is very sensitive to the presence of ""cars"" in the image. We propose an object removal based data augmentation solution to mitigate this dependency and increase the robustness of classification and segmentation models to contextual variations. Our experiments show that the proposed data augmentation helps these models improve the performance in out-of-context scenarios, while preserving the performance on regular data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Not,Using,the,Car,to,See,the,Sidewalk,--,Quantifying,and,Controlling,the,Effects,of,Context,in,Classification,and,Segmentation"
402,Discovering Fair Representations in the Data Domain,"Interpretability and fairness are critical in computer vision and machine learning applications, in particular when dealing with human outcomes, e.g. inviting or not inviting for a job interview based on application materials that may include photographs. One promising direction to achieve fairness is by learning data representations that remove the semantics of protected characteristics, and are therefore able to mitigate unfair outcomes. All available models however learn latent embeddings which comes at the cost of being uninterpretable. We propose to cast this problem as data-to-data translation, i.e. learning a mapping from an input domain to a fair target domain, where a fairness definition is being enforced. Here the data domain can be images, or any tabular data representation. This task would be straightforward if we had fair target data available, but this is not the case. To overcome this, we learn a highly unconstrained mapping by exploiting statistics of residuals -- the difference between input data and its translated version -- and the protected characteristics. When applied to the CelebA dataset of face images with gender attribute as the protected characteristic, our model enforces equality of opportunity by adjusting the eyes and lips regions. Intriguingly, on the same dataset we arrive at similar conclusions when using semantic attribute representations of images for translation. On face images of the recent DiF dataset, with the same gender attribute, our method adjusts nose regions. In the Adult income dataset, also with protected gender attribute, our model achieves equality of opportunity by, among others, obfuscating the wife and husband relationship. Analyzing those systematic changes will allow us to scrutinize the interplay of fairness criterion, chosen protected characteristics, and prediction performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Discovering,Fair,Representations,in,the,Data,Domain"
403,Actor-Critic Instance Segmentation,"Most approaches to visual scene analysis have emphasised parallel processing of the image elements. However, one area in which the sequential nature of vision is apparent, is that of segmenting multiple, potentially similar and partially occluded objects in a scene. In this work, we revisit the recurrent formulation of this challenging problem in the context of reinforcement learning. Motivated by the limitations of the global max-matching assignment of the ground-truth segments to the recurrent states, we develop an actor-critic approach in which the actor recurrently predicts one instance mask at a time and utilises the gradient from a concurrently trained critic network. We formulate the state, action, and the reward such as to let the critic model long-term effects of the current prediction and in- corporate this information into the gradient signal. Furthermore, to enable effective exploration in the inherently high-dimensional action space of instance masks, we learn a compact representation using a conditional variational auto-encoder. We show that our actor-critic model consistently provides accuracy benefits over the recurrent baseline on standard instance segmentation benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Actor-Critic,Instance,Segmentation"
404,Generalized Zero- and Few-Shot Learning via Aligned Variational Autoencoders,"Many approaches in generalized zero-shot learning rely on cross-modal mapping between the image feature space and the class embedding space. As labeled images are expensive, one direction is to augment the dataset by generating either images or image features. However, the former misses fine-grained details and the latter requires learning a mapping associated with class embeddings. In this work, we take feature generation one step further and propose a model where a shared latent space of image features and class embeddings is learned by modality-specific aligned variational autoencoders. This leaves us with the required discriminative information about the image and classes in the latent features, on which we train a softmax classifier. The key to our approach is that we align the distributions learned from images and from side-information to construct latent features that contain the essential multi-modal information associated with unseen classes. We evaluate our learned latent features on several benchmark datasets, i.e. CUB, SUN, AWA1 and AWA2, and establish a new state of the art on generalized zero-shot as well as on few-shot learning. Moreover, our results on ImageNet with various zero-shot splits show that our latent features generalize well in large-scale settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generalized,Zero-,and,Few-Shot,Learning,via,Aligned,Variational,Autoencoders"
405,Semantic Projection Network for Zero- and Few-Label Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and pixel-level labelling in this context is particularly expensive. Hence, there have been several attempts to reduce the annotation effort such as learning from image level labels and bounding box annotations. In this paper we take this one step further and focus on the challenging task of zero- and few-shot learning of semantic segmentation. We define this task as image segmentation by assigning a label to every pixel even though either no labeled sample of that class was present during training, i.e. zero-label semantic segmentation, or only a few labeled samples were present, i.e. few-label semantic segmentation.Our goal is to transfer the knowledge from previously seen classes to novel classes. Our proposed semantic projection network (SPNet) achieves this goal by incorporating a class-level semantic information into any network designed for semantic segmentation, in an end-to-end manner. We also propose a benchmark for this task on the challenging COCO-Stuff and PASCAL VOC12 datasets. Our model is effective in segmenting novel classes, i.e. alleviating expensive dense annotations, but also in adapting to novel classes without forgetting its prior knowledge, i.e. generalized zero- and few-label semantic segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semantic,Projection,Network,for,Zero-,and,Few-Label,Semantic,Segmentation"
406,GCAN: Graph Convolutional Adversarial Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"To bridge source and target domains for domain adaptation, there are three important types of information including data structure, domain label, and class label. Most existing domain adaptation approaches exploit only one or two types of this information and cannot make them complement and enhance each other. Different from existing methods, we propose an end-to-end Graph Convolutional Adversarial Network (GCAN) for unsupervised domain adaptation by jointly modeling data structure, domain label, and class label in a unified deep framework. The proposed GCAN model enjoys several merits. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the three kinds of information jointly in a deep model for unsupervised domain adaptation. Second, the proposed model has designed three effective alignment mechanisms including structure-aware alignment, domain alignment, and class centroid alignment, which can learn domain-invariant and semantic representations effectively to reduce the domain discrepancy for domain adaptation. Extensive experimental results on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GCAN algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"GCAN:,Graph,Convolutional,Adversarial,Network,for,Unsupervised,Domain,Adaptation"

The proposed architecture takes advantage of a novel segmentation head that seamlessly integrates multi-scale features generated by a Feature Pyramid Network with contextual information conveyed by a light-weight DeepLab-like module. As additional contribution we review the panoptic metric and propose an alternative that overcomes its limitations when evaluating non-instance categories.

In computer vision, unsu- pervised learning comes in various guises. We focus here on the unsupervised discovery and matching of object cate- gories among images in a collection, following the work of Cho et al. [12].

409,Wide-Area Crowd Counting via Ground-Plane Density Maps and Multi-View Fusion CNNs,"Crowd counting in single-view images has achieved outstanding performance on existing counting datasets. However, single-view counting is not applicable to large and wide scenes (e.g., public parks, long subway platforms, or event spaces) because a single camera cannot capture the whole scene in adequate detail for counting, e.g., when the scene is too large to fit into the field-of-view of the camera,  too long so that the resolution is too low on faraway crowds, or when there are too many large objects that occlude large portions of the crowd. Therefore, to solve the wide-area counting task requires multiple cameras with overlapping fields-of-view.  In this paper, we propose a deep neural network framework for multi-view crowd counting, which fuses information from multiple camera views to predict a scene-level density map on the ground-plane of the 3D world. We consider 3 versions of the fusion framework: the late fusion model fuses camera-view density map; the naive early fusion model fuses camera-view feature maps; and the multi-view multi-scale early fusion model favors that features aligned to the same ground-plane point have consistent scales. We test our 3 fusion models on 3 multi-view counting datasets, PETS2009, DukeMTMC, and a newly collected multi-view counting dataset containing a crowded street intersection. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other multi-view counting baselines.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Wide-Area,Crowd,Counting,via,Ground-Plane,Density,Maps,and,Multi-View,Fusion,CNNs"

As an image can be described in infinite ways depending on the goal and the context at hand, a higher degree of controllability is needed to apply captioning algorithms in complex scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for image captioning which can generate diverse descriptions by allowing both grounding and controllability. Given a control signal in the form of a sequence or set of image regions, we generate the corresponding caption through a recurrent architecture which predicts textual chunks explicitly grounded on regions, following the constraints of the given control. Experiments are conducted on Flickr30k Entities and on COCO Entities, an extended version of COCO in which we add grounding annotations collected in a semi-automatic manner. Results demonstrate that our method achieves state of the art performances on controllable image captioning, in terms of caption quality and diversity.

411,Towards VQA Models That Can Read,"Studies have shown that a dominant class of questions asked by visually impaired users on images of their surroundings involves reading text in the image. But today's VQA models can not read! Our paper takes a first step towards addressing this problem. First, we introduce a new ""TextVQA"" dataset to facilitate progress on this important problem. Existing datasets either have a small proportion of questions about text (e.g., the VQA dataset) or are too small (e.g., the VizWiz dataset). TextVQA contains 45,336 questions on 28,408 images that require reasoning about text to answer. Second, we introduce a novel model architecture that reads text in the image, reasons about it in the context of the image and the question, and predicts an answer which might be a deduction based on the text and the image or composed of the strings found in the image. Consequently, we call our approach Look, Read, Reason & Answer (LoRRA). We show that LoRRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art VQA models on our TextVQA dataset. We find that the gap between human performance and machine performance is significantly larger on TextVQA than on VQA 2.0, suggesting that TextVQA is well-suited to benchmark progress along directions complementary to VQA 2.0.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,VQA,Models,That,Can,Read"
412,Object-Aware Aggregation With Bidirectional Temporal Graph for Video Captioning,"Video captioning aims to automatically generate natural language descriptions of video content, which has drawn a lot of attention recent years. Generating accurate and fine-grained captions needs to not only understand the global content of video, but also capture the detailed object information. Meanwhile, video representations have great impact on the quality of generated captions. Thus, it is important for video captioning to capture salient objects with their detailed temporal dynamics, and represent them using discriminative spatio-temporal representations.  In this paper, we propose a new video captioning approach based on object-aware aggregation with bidirectional temporal graph (OA-BTG), which captures detailed temporal dynamics for salient objects in video, and learns discriminative spatio-temporal representations by performing object-aware local feature aggregation on detected object regions. The main novelties and advantages are:  (1) Bidirectional temporal graph: A bidirectional temporal graph is constructed along and reversely along the temporal order, which provides complementary ways to capture the temporal trajectories for each salient object. (2) Object-aware aggregation: Learnable VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) models are constructed on object temporal trajectories and global frame sequence, which performs object-aware aggregation to learn discriminative representations. A hierarchical attention mechanism is also developed to distinguish different contributions of multiple objects. Experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate our OA-BTG achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of BLEU@4, METEOR and CIDEr metrics.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Object-Aware,Aggregation,With,Bidirectional,Temporal,Graph,for,Video,Captioning"
413,Progressive Attention Memory Network for Movie Story Question Answering,"This paper proposes the progressive attention memory network (PAMN) for movie story question answering (QA). Movie story QA is challenging compared to VQA in two aspects: (1) pinpointing the temporal parts relevant to answer the question is difficult as the movies are typically longer than an hour, (2) it has both video and subtitle where different questions require different modality to infer the answer. To overcome these challenges, PAMN involves three main features: (1) progressive attention mechanism that utilizes cues from both question and answer to progressively prune out irrelevant temporal parts in memory, (2) dynamic modality fusion that adaptively determines the contribution of each modality for answering the current question, and (3) belief correction answering scheme that successively corrects the prediction score on each candidate answer. Experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets, MovieQA and TVQA, demonstrate that each feature contributes to our movie story QA architecture, PAMN, and improves performance to achieve the state-of-the-art result.

A potential disadvantage of such design is that it cannot capture the multiple visual context information of a word appearing in more than one relevant videos in training data. To tackle this limitation, we propose the Memory-Attended Recurrent Network (MARN) for video captioning, in which a memory structure is designed to explore the full-spectrum correspondence between a word and its various similar visual contexts across videos in training data. Thus, our model is able to achieve a more comprehensive understanding for each word and yield higher captioning quality. Furthermore, the built memory structure enables our method to model the compatibility between adjacent words explicitly instead of asking the model to learn implicitly, as most existing models do. Extensive validation on two real-word datasets demonstrates that our MARN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Memory-Attended,Recurrent,Network,for,Video,Captioning"

This paper proposes a novel method to address the VQA problem. In contrast to prior works, our method that targets single scene VQA, replies on graph-based techniques and involves reasoning. In a nutshell, our approach is centered on three graphs. The first graph, referred to as inference graph G_I, is constructed via learning over labeled data. The other two graphs, referred to as query graph Q and entity-attribute graph EAG, are generated from natural language query NLQ and image Img, that are issued from users, respectively. As EAG often does not take sufficient information to answer Q, we develop techniques to infer missing information of EAG with G_I. Based on EAG and Q, we provide techniques to find matches of Q in EAG, as the answer of NLQ in Img. Unlike commonly used  VQA methods that are based on end-to-end neural networks, our graph-based method shows well-designed reasoning capability, and thus is highly interpretable. We also create a dataset on soccer match (Soccer-VQA) with rich annotations. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method and has high potential for future investigation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Visual,Query,Answering,by,Entity-Attribute,Graph,Matching,and,Reasoning"

We propose Look Back (LB) method to embed visual information from the past and Predict Forward (PF) approach to look into future. LB method introduces attention value from the previous time step into the current attention generation to suit visual coherence of human. PF model predicts the next two words in one time step and jointly employs their probabilities for inference. Then the two approaches are combined together as LBPF to further integrate visual information from the past and linguistic information in the future to improve image captioning performance. All the three methods are applied on a classic base decoder, and show remarkable improvements on MSCOCO dataset with small increments on parameter counts. Our LBPF model achieves BLEU-4 / CIDEr / SPICE scores of 37.4 / 116.4 / 21.2 with cross-entropy loss and  38.3 / 127.6 / 22.0 with CIDEr optimization.

417,Explainable and Explicit Visual Reasoning Over Scene Graphs,"We aim to dismantle the prevalent black-box neural architectures used in complex visual reasoning tasks, into the proposed eXplainable and eXplicit Neural Modules (XNMs), which advance beyond existing neural module networks towards using scene graphs --- objects as nodes and the pairwise relationships as edges --- for explainable and explicit reasoning with structured knowledge. XNMs allow us to pay more attention to teach machines how to ""think"", regardless of what they ""look"". As we will show in the paper, by using scene graphs as an inductive bias, 1) we can design XNMs in a concise and flexible fashion, i.e., XNMs merely consist of 4 meta-types, which significantly reduce the number of parameters by 10 to 100 times, and 2) we can explicitly trace the reasoning-flow in terms of graph attentions. XNMs are so generic that they support a wide range of scene graph implementations with various qualities. For example, when the graphs are detected perfectly, XNMs achieve 100% accuracy on both CLEVR and CLEVR CoGenT, establishing an empirical performance upper-bound for visual reasoning; when the graphs are noisily detected from real-world images, XNMs are still robust to achieve a competitive 67.5% accuracy on VQAv2.0, surpassing the popular bag-of-objects attention models without graph structures.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Explainable,and,Explicit,Visual,Reasoning,Over,Scene,Graphs"
418,Transfer Learning via Unsupervised Task Discovery for Visual Question Answering,"We study how to leverage off-the-shelf visual and linguistic data to cope with out-of-vocabulary answers in visual question answering task. Existing large-scale visual datasets with annotations such as image class labels, bounding boxes and region descriptions are good sources for learning rich and diverse visual concepts. However, it is not straightforward how the visual concepts can be captured and transferred to visual question answering models due to missing link between question dependent answering models and visual data without question. We tackle this problem in two steps: 1) learning a task conditional visual classifier, which is capable of solving diverse question-specific visual recognition tasks, based on unsupervised task discovery and 2) transferring the task conditional visual classifier to visual question answering models. Specifically, we employ linguistic knowledge sources such as structured lexical database (e.g. WordNet) and visual descriptions for unsupervised task discovery, and transfer a learned task conditional visual classifier as an answering unit in a visual question answering model. We empirically show that the proposed algorithm generalizes to out-of-vocabulary answers successfully using the knowledge transferred from the visual dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Transfer,Learning,via,Unsupervised,Task,Discovery,for,Visual,Question,Answering"
419,Intention Oriented Image Captions With Guiding Objects,"Although existing image caption models can produce promising results using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), it is difficult to guarantee that an object we care about is contained in generated descriptions, for example in the case that the object is inconspicuous in the image. Problems become even harder when these objects did not appear in training stage. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating image captions with guiding objects (CGO). The CGO constrains the model to involve a human-concerned object when the object is in the image. CGO ensures that the object is in the generated description while maintaining fluency. Instead of generating the sequence from left to right, we start the description with a selected object and generate other parts of the sequence based on this object. To achieve this, we design a novel framework combining two LSTMs in opposite directions. We demonstrate the characteristics of our method on MSCOCO where we generate descriptions for each detected object in the images. With CGO, we can extend the ability of description to the objects being neglected in image caption labels and provide a set of more comprehensive and diverse descriptions for an image. CGO shows advantages when applied to the task of describing novel objects. We show experimental results on both MSCOCO and ImageNet datasets. Evaluations show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the task with average F1 75.8, leading to better descriptions in terms of both content accuracy and fluency.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Intention,Oriented,Image,Captions,With,Guiding,Objects"
420,Uncertainty Guided Multi-Scale Residual Learning-Using a Cycle Spinning CNN for Single Image De-Raining,"Single image de-raining is an extremely challenging problem since the rainy image may contain rain streaks which may vary in size, direction and density. Previous approaches have attempted to address this problem by leveraging some prior information to remove rain streaks from a single image. One of the major limitations of these approaches is that they do not consider the location information of rain drops in the image. The proposed Uncertainty guided Multi-scale Residual Learning (UMRL) network attempts to address this issue by learning the rain content at different scales and using them to estimate the final de-rained output. In addition, we introduce a technique which guides the network to learn the network weights based on the confidence measure about the estimate. Furthermore, we introduce a new training and testing procedure based on the notion of cycle spinning to improve the final de-raining performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the recent state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Uncertainty,Guided,Multi-Scale,Residual,Learning-Using,a,Cycle,Spinning,CNN,for,Single,Image,De-Raining"
421,Toward Realistic Image Compositing With Adversarial Learning,"Compositing a realistic image is a challenging task and usually requires considerable human supervision using professional image editing software. In this work we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture for automatic image compositing. The proposed model consists of four sub-networks: a transformation network that improves the geometric and color consistency of the composite image, a refinement network that polishes the boundary of the composite image, and a pair of discriminator network and a segmentation network for adversarial learning. Experimental results on both synthesized images and real images show that our model, Geometrically and Color Consistent GANs (GCC-GANs), can automatically generate realistic composite images compared to several state-of-the-art methods, and does not require any manual effort.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Toward,Realistic,Image,Compositing,With,Adversarial,Learning"
422,Cross-Classification Clustering: An Efficient Multi-Object Tracking Technique for 3-D Instance Segmentation in Connectomics,"Pixel-accurate tracking of objects is a key element in many computer vision applications, often solved by iterated individual object tracking or instance segmentation followed by object matching. Here we introduce cross-classification clustering (3C), a technique that simultaneously tracks complex, interrelated objects in an image stack. The key idea in cross-classification is to efficiently turn a clustering problem into a classification problem by running a logarithmic number of independent classifications per image, letting the cross-labeling of these classifications uniquely classify each pixel to the object labels. We apply the 3C mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in connectomics -- the nanoscale mapping of neural tissue from electron microscopy volumes. Our reconstruction system increases scalability by an order of magnitude over existing single-object tracking methods (such as flood-filling networks). This scalability is important for the deployment of connectomics pipelines, since currently the best performing techniques require computing infrastructures that are beyond the reach of most laboratories. Our algorithm may offer benefits in other domains that require pixel-accurate tracking of multiple objects, such as segmentation of videos and medical imagery.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cross-Classification,Clustering:,An,Efficient,Multi-Object,Tracking,Technique,for,3-D,Instance,Segmentation,in,Connectomics"
423,Deep ChArUco: Dark ChArUco Marker Pose Estimation,"ChArUco boards are used for camera calibration, monocular pose estimation, and pose verification in both robotics and augmented reality. Such fiducials are detectable via traditional computer vision methods (as found in OpenCV) in well-lit environments, but classical methods fail when the lighting is poor or when the image undergoes extreme motion blur. We present Deep ChArUco, a real-time pose estimation system which combines two custom deep networks, ChArUcoNet and RefineNet, with the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm to estimate the marker's 6DoF pose. ChArUcoNet is a two-headed marker-specific convolutional neural network (CNN) which jointly outputs ID-specific classifiers and 2D point locations. The 2D point locations are further refined into subpixel coordinates using RefineNet. Our networks are trained using a combination of auto-labeled videos of the target marker, synthetic subpixel corner data, and extreme data augmentation. We evaluate Deep ChArUco in challenging low-light, high-motion, high-blur scenarios and demonstrate that our approach is superior to a traditional OpenCV-based method for ChArUco marker detection and pose estimation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,ChArUco:,Dark,ChArUco,Marker,Pose,Estimation"
424,Pseudo-LiDAR From Visual Depth Estimation: Bridging the Gap in 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving,"3D object detection is an essential task in autonomous driving. Recent techniques excel with highly accurate detection rates, provided the 3D input data is obtained from precise but expensive LiDAR technology. Approaches based on cheaper monocular or stereo imagery data have, until now, resulted in drastically lower accuracies --- a gap that is commonly attributed to poor image-based depth estimation. However, in this paper we argue that it is not the quality of the data but its representation that accounts for the majority of the difference. Taking the inner workings of convolutional neural networks into consideration, we propose to convert image-based depth maps to pseudo-LiDAR representations  --- essentially mimicking the LiDAR signal. With this representation we can apply different existing LiDAR-based detection algorithms. On the popular KITTI benchmark, our approach achieves impressive improvements over the existing state-of-the-art in image-based performance --- raising the detection accuracy of objects within the 30m range from the previous state-of-the-art of 22% to an unprecedented 74%. At the time of submission our algorithm holds the highest entry on the KITTI 3D object detection leaderboard for stereo-image-based approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pseudo-LiDAR,From,Visual,Depth,Estimation:,Bridging,the,Gap,in,3D,Object,Detection,for,Autonomous,Driving"
425,Rules of the Road: Predicting Driving Behavior With a Convolutional Model of Semantic Interactions,"We focus on the problem of predicting future states of entities in complex, real-world driving scenarios.  Previous research has approached this problem via low-level signals to predict short time horizons, and has not addressed how to leverage key assets relied upon heavily by industry self-driving systems: (1) large 3D perception efforts which provide highly accurate 3D states of agents with rich attributes, and (2) detailed and accurate semantic maps of the environment (lanes, traffic lights, crosswalks, etc). We present a unified representation which encodes such high-level semantic information in a spatial grid, allowing the use of deep convolutional models to fuse complex scene context. This enables learning entity-entity and entity-environment interactions with simple, feed-forward computations in each timestep within an overall temporal model of an agent's behavior.  We propose different ways of modelling the future as a   distribution  over future states using standard supervised learning. We introduce a novel dataset providing industry-grade rich perception and semantic inputs, and empirically show we can effectively learn fundamentals of driving behavior.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Rules,of,the,Road:,Predicting,Driving,Behavior,With,a,Convolutional,Model,of,Semantic,Interactions"
426,Metric Learning for Image Registration,"Image registration is a key technique in medical image analysis to estimate deformations between image pairs. A good deformation model is important for high-quality estimates. However, most existing approaches use ad-hoc deformation models chosen for mathematical convenience rather than to capture observed data variation. Recent deep learning approaches learn deformation models directly from data. However, they provide limited control over the spatial regularity of transformations. Instead of learning the entire registration approach, we learn a spatially-adaptive regularizer within a registration model. This allows controlling the desired level of regularity and preserving structural properties of a registration model. For example, diffeomorphic transformations can be attained. Our approach is a radical departure from existing deep learning approaches to image registration by embedding a deep learning model in an optimization-based registration algorithm to parameterize and data-adapt the registration model itself.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Metric,Learning,for,Image,Registration"
427,LO-Net: Deep Real-Time Lidar Odometry,"We present a novel deep convolutional network pipeline, LO-Net, for real-time lidar odometry estimation. Unlike most existing lidar odometry (LO) estimations that go through individually designed feature selection, feature matching, and pose estimation pipeline, LO-Net can be trained in an end-to-end manner. With a new mask-weighted geometric constraint loss, LO-Net can effectively learn feature representation for LO estimation, and can implicitly exploit the sequential dependencies and dynamics in the data. We also design a scan-to-map module, which uses the geometric and semantic information learned in LO-Net, to improve the estimation accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LO-Net outperforms existing learning based approaches and has similar accuracy with the state-of-the-art geometry-based approach, LOAM.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LO-Net:,Deep,Real-Time,Lidar,Odometry"
428,TraPHic: Trajectory Prediction in Dense and Heterogeneous Traffic Using Weighted Interactions,"We present a new algorithm for predicting the near-term trajectories of road agents in dense traffic videos. Our approach is designed for heterogeneous traffic, where the road agents may correspond to buses, cars, scooters, bi-cycles, or pedestrians. We model the interactions between different road agents using a novel LSTM-CNN hybrid network for trajectory prediction. In particular, we take into account heterogeneous interactions that implicitly account for the varying shapes, dynamics, and behaviors of different road agents. In addition, we model horizon-based interactions which are used to implicitly model the driving behavior of each road agent. We evaluate the performance of our prediction algorithm, TraPHic, on the standard datasets and also introduce a new dense, heterogeneous traffic dataset corresponding to urban Asian videos and agent trajectories. We outperform state-of-the-art methods on dense traffic datasets by 30%.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"TraPHic:,Trajectory,Prediction,in,Dense,and,Heterogeneous,Traffic,Using,Weighted,Interactions"
429,World From Blur,"What can we tell from a single motion-blurred image? We show in this paper that a  3D  scene can be revealed. Unlike prior methods that focus on producing a deblurred image, we propose to estimate and take advantage of the hidden message of a blurred image, the relative motion trajectory, to restore the 3D scene collapsed during the exposure process. To this end, we train a deep network that jointly predicts the motion trajectory, the deblurred image, and the depth one, all of which in turn form a collaborative and self-supervised cycle that supervise one another to reproduce the input blurred image,  enabling plausible 3D scene reconstruction from a single blurred image. We test the proposed model on several large-scale datasets we constructed based on benchmarks, as well as real-world blurred images, and show that it yields very encouraging quantitative and qualitative results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"World,From,Blur"
430,Topology Reconstruction of Tree-Like Structure in Images via Structural Similarity Measure and Dominant Set Clustering,"The reconstruction and analysis of tree-like topological structures in the biomedical images is crucial  for biologists and surgeons to understand biomedical conditions and plan surgical procedures. The underlying tree-structure topology reveals how different curvilinear components are anatomically connected to each other. Existing automated topology reconstruction methods have great difficulty in identifying the connectivity when two or more curvilinear components cross or bifurcate, due to their projection ambiguity, imaging noise and low contrast. In this paper, we propose a novel curvilinear structural similarity measure to guide a dominant-set clustering approach to address this indispensable issue. The novel similarity measure takes into account both intensity and geometric properties in representing  the curvilinear structure locally and globally, and group curvilinear objects at crossover points into different connected branches by dominant-set clustering.  The proposed method is applicable to different imaging modalities, and quantitative and qualitative results on retinal vessel, plant root, and neuronal network datasets show that our methodology is capable of advancing the current state-of-the-art techniques.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Topology,Reconstruction,of,Tree-Like,Structure,in,Images,via,Structural,Similarity,Measure,and,Dominant,Set,Clustering"
431,Pyramidal Person Re-IDentification via Multi-Loss Dynamic Training,"Most existing Re-IDentification (Re-ID) methods are highly dependent on precise bounding boxes that enable images to be aligned with each other. However, due to the challenging practical scenarios, current detection models often produce inaccurate bounding boxes, which inevitably degenerate the performance of existing Re-ID algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine pyramid model to relax the need of bounding boxes, which not only incorporates local and global information, but also integrates the gradual cues between them. The pyramid model is able to match at different scales and then search for the correct image of the same identity, even when the image pairs are not aligned. In addition, in order to learn discriminative identity representation, we explore a dynamic training scheme to seamlessly unify two losses and extract appropriate shared information between them. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on three datasets. Especially, our approach exceeds the current best method by 9.5% on the most challenging CUHK03 dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pyramidal,Person,Re-IDentification,via,Multi-Loss,Dynamic,Training"
