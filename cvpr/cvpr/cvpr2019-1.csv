0,Finding Task-Relevant Features for Few-Shot Learning by Category Traversal,"Few-shot learning is an important area of research.  Conceptually, humans are readily able to understand new concepts given just a few examples, while in more pragmatic terms, limited-example training situations are common practice. Recent effective approaches to few-shot learning employ a metric-learning framework to learn a feature similarity comparison between a query (test) example, and the few support (training) examples.  However, these approaches treat each support class independently from one another, never looking at the entire task as a whole.  Because of this, they are constrained to use a single set of features for all possible test-time tasks, which hinders the ability to distinguish the most relevant dimensions for the task at hand.  In this work, we introduce a Category Traversal Module that can be inserted as a plug-and-play module into most metric-learning based few-shot learners.  This component traverses across the entire support set at once, identifying task-relevant features based on both intra-class commonality and inter-class uniqueness in the feature space.  Incorporating our module improves performance considerably (5%-10% relative) over baseline systems on both miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks, with overall performance competitive with the most recent state-of-the-art systems.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Finding,Task-Relevant,Features,for,Few-Shot,Learning,by,Category,Traversal"
1,Edge-Labeling Graph Neural Network for Few-Shot Learning,"In this paper, we propose a novel edge-labeling graph neural network (EGNN), which adapts a deep neural network on the edge-labeling graph, for few-shot learning. The previous graph neural network (GNN) approaches in few-shot learning have been based on the node-labeling framework, which implicitly models the intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. In contrast, the proposed EGNN learns to predict the edge-labels rather than the node-labels on the graph that enables the evolution of an explicit clustering by iteratively updating the edge-labels with direct exploitation of both intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. It is also well suited for performing on various numbers of classes without retraining, and can be easily extended to perform a transductive inference. The parameters of the EGNN are learned by episodic training with an edge-labeling loss to obtain a well-generalizable model for unseen low-data problem. On both of the supervised and semi-supervised few-shot image classification tasks with two benchmark datasets, the proposed EGNN significantly improves the performances over the existing GNNs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Edge-Labeling,Graph,Neural,Network,for,Few-Shot,Learning"
2,Generating Classification Weights With GNN Denoising Autoencoders for Few-Shot Learning,"Given an initial recognition model already trained on a set of base classes, the goal of this work is to develop a meta-model for few-shot learning. The meta-model, given as input some novel classes with few training examples per class, must properly adapt the existing recognition model into a new model that can correctly classify in a unified way both the novel and the base classes. To accomplish this goal it must learn to output the appropriate classification weight vectors for those two types of classes. To build our meta-model we make use of two main innovations: we propose the use of a Denoising Autoencoder network (DAE) that (during training) takes as input a set of classification weights corrupted with Gaussian noise and learns to reconstruct the target-discriminative classification weights. In this case, the injected noise on the classification weights serves the role of regularizing the weight generating meta-model. Furthermore, in order to capture the co-dependencies between different classes in a given task instance of our meta-model, we propose to implement the DAE model as a Graph Neural Network (GNN). In order to verify the efficacy of our approach, we extensively evaluate it on ImageNet based few-shot benchmarks and we report state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generating,Classification,Weights,With,GNN,Denoising,Autoencoders,for,Few-Shot,Learning"
3,Kervolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled the state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, little effort has been devoted to establishing convolution in non-linear space. Existing works mainly leverage on the activation layers, which can only provide point-wise non-linearity. To solve this problem, a new operation, kervolution (kernel convolution), is introduced to approximate complex behaviors of human perception systems leveraging on the kernel trick. It generalizes convolution, enhances the model capacity, and captures higher order interactions of features, via patch-wise kernel functions, but without introducing additional parameters. Extensive experiments show that kervolutional neural networks (KNN) achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence than baseline CNN.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Kervolutional,Neural,Networks"
4,Why ReLU Networks Yield High-Confidence Predictions Far Away From the Training Data and How to Mitigate the Problem,"Classifiers used in the wild, in particular for safety-critical systems, should not only have good generalization properties but also should know when they don't know, in particular make low confidence predictions far away from the training data. We show that ReLU type neural networks which yield a piecewise linear classifier function fail in this regard as they produce almost always high confidence predictions far away from the training data. For bounded domains like images we propose a new robust optimization technique similar to adversarial training which enforces low confidence predictions far away from the training data. We show that this technique is surprisingly effective in reducing the confidence of predictions far away from the training data while maintaining high confidence predictions and test error on the original classification task compared to standard training.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Why,ReLU,Networks,Yield,High-Confidence,Predictions,Far,Away,From,the,Training,Data,and,How,to,Mitigate,the,Problem"
5,On the Structural Sensitivity of Deep Convolutional Networks to the Directions of Fourier Basis Functions,"Data-agnostic quasi-imperceptible perturbations on inputs are known to degrade recognition accuracy of deep convolutional networks severely. This phenomenon is considered to be a potential security issue. Moreover, some results on statistical generalization guarantees indicate that the phenomena can be a key to improve the networks' generalization. However, the characteristics of the shared directions of such harmful perturbations remain unknown. Our primal finding is that convolutional networks are sensitive to the directions of Fourier basis functions. We derived the property by specializing a hypothesis of the cause of the sensitivity, known as the linearity of neural networks, to convolutional networks and empirically validated it. As a byproduct of the analysis, we propose an algorithm to create shift-invariant universal adversarial perturbations available in black-box settings.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"On,the,Structural,Sensitivity,of,Deep,Convolutional,Networks,to,the,Directions,of,Fourier,Basis,Functions"
6,Neural Rejuvenation: Improving Deep Network Training by Enhancing Computational Resource Utilization,"In this paper, we study the problem of improving computational resource utilization of neural networks. Deep neural networks are usually over-parameterized for their tasks in order to achieve good performances, thus are likely to have underutilized computational resources. This observation motivates a lot of research topics, e.g. network pruning, architecture search, etc. As models with higher computational costs (e.g. more parameters or more computations) usually have better performances, we study the problem of improving the resource utilization of neural networks so that their potentials can be further realized. To this end, we propose a novel optimization method named Neural Rejuvenation. As its name suggests, our method detects dead neurons and computes resource utilization in real time, rejuvenates dead neurons by resource reallocation and reinitialization, and trains them with new training schemes. By simply replacing standard optimizers with Neural Rejuvenation, we are able to improve the performances of neural networks by a very large margin while using similar training efforts and maintaining their original resource usages.

7,Hardness-Aware Deep Metric Learning,"This paper presents a hardness-aware deep metric learning (HDML) framework. Most previous deep metric learning methods employ the hard negative mining strategy to alleviate the lack of informative samples for training. However, this mining strategy only utilizes a subset of training data, which may not be enough to characterize the global geometry of the embedding space comprehensively. To address this problem, we perform linear interpolation on embeddings to adaptively manipulate their hard levels and generate corresponding label-preserving synthetics for recycled training, so that information buried in all samples can be fully exploited and the metric is always challenged with proper difficulty. Our method achieves very competitive performance on the widely used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Hardness-Aware,Deep,Metric,Learning"
8,Auto-DeepLab: Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has successfully identified neural network architectures that exceed human designed ones on large-scale image classification. In this paper, we study NAS for semantic image segmentation. Existing works often focus on searching the repeatable cell structure, while hand-designing the outer network structure that controls the spatial resolution changes. This choice simplifies the search space, but becomes increasingly problematic for dense image prediction which exhibits a lot more network level architectural variations. Therefore, we propose to search the network level structure in addition to the cell level structure, which forms a hierarchical architecture search space. We present a network level search space that includes many popular designs, and develop a formulation that allows efficient gradient-based architecture search (3 P100 GPU days on Cityscapes images). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the challenging Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets. Auto-DeepLab, our architecture searched specifically for semantic image segmentation, attains state-of-the-art performance without any ImageNet pretraining.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Auto-DeepLab:,Hierarchical,Neural,Architecture,Search,for,Semantic,Image,Segmentation"
9,Learning Loss for Active Learning,"The performance of deep neural networks improves with more annotated data. The problem is that the budget for annotation is limited. One solution to this is active learning, where a model asks human to annotate data that it perceived as uncertain. A variety of recent methods have been proposed to apply active learning to deep networks but most of them are either designed specific for their target tasks or computationally inefficient for large networks. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method that is simple but task-agnostic, and works efficiently with the deep networks. We attach a small parametric module, named ""loss prediction module,"" to a target network, and learn it to predict target losses of unlabeled inputs. Then, this module can suggest data that the target model is likely to produce a wrong prediction. This method is task-agnostic as networks are learned from a single loss regardless of target tasks. We rigorously validate our method through image classification, object detection, and human pose estimation, with the recent network architectures. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the previous methods over the tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Loss,for,Active,Learning"
10,Striking the Right Balance With Uncertainty,"Learning unbiased models on imbalanced datasets is a significant challenge. Rare classes tend to get a concentrated representation in the classification space which hampers the generalization of learned boundaries to new test examples. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Bayesian uncertainty estimates directly correlate with the rarity of classes and the difficulty level of individual samples. Subsequently, we present a novel framework for uncertainty based class imbalance learning that follows two key insights: First, classification boundaries should be extended further away from a more uncertain (rare) class to avoid over-fitting and enhance its generalization. Second, each sample should be modeled as a multi-variate Gaussian distribution with a mean vector and a covariance matrix defined by the sample's uncertainty. The learned boundaries should respect not only the individual samples but also their distribution in the feature space. Our proposed approach efficiently utilizes sample and class uncertainty information to learn robust features and more generalizable classifiers. We systematically study the class imbalance problem and derive a novel loss formulation for max-margin learning based on Bayesian uncertainty measure. The proposed method shows significant performance improvements on six benchmark datasets for face verification, attribute prediction, digit/object classification and skin lesion detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Striking,the,Right,Balance,With,Uncertainty"
11,AutoAugment: Learning Augmentation Strategies From Data,"Data augmentation is an effective technique for improving the accuracy of modern image classifiers. However, current data augmentation implementations are manually designed. In this paper, we describe a simple procedure called AutoAugment to automatically search for improved data augmentation policies. In our implementation, we have designed a search space where a policy consists of many sub-policies, one of which is randomly chosen for each image in each mini-batch. A sub-policy consists of two operations, each operation being an image processing function such as translation, rotation, or shearing, and the probabilities and magnitudes with which the functions are applied.  We use a search algorithm to find the best policy such that the neural network yields the highest validation accuracy on a target dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet (without additional data). On ImageNet, we attain a Top-1 accuracy of 83.5% which is 0.4% better than the previous record of 83.1%. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an error rate of 1.5%, which is 0.6% better than the previous state-of-the-art. Augmentation policies we find are  transferable between datasets.  The policy learned on ImageNet transfers well to achieve significant improvements on other datasets, such as Oxford Flowers, Caltech-101, Oxford-IIT Pets, FGVC Aircraft, and Stanford Cars.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"AutoAugment:,Learning,Augmentation,Strategies,From,Data"
12,SDRSAC: Semidefinite-Based Randomized Approach for Robust Point Cloud Registration Without Correspondences,"This paper presents a novel randomized algorithm for robust point cloud registration without correspondences. Most existing registration approaches require a set of putative correspondences obtained by extracting invariant descriptors. However, such descriptors could become unreliable in noisy and contaminated settings. In these settings, methods that directly handle input point sets are preferable.  Without correspondences, however,   conventional randomized techniques require a very large number of samples in order to reach satisfactory solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem. In particular, our work enables the use of randomized methods for point cloud registration without the need of putative correspondences. By considering point cloud alignment as a special instance of graph matching and employing an efficient semi-definite relaxation, we propose a novel sampling mechanism, in which the size of the sampled subsets can be larger-than-minimal. Our tight relaxation scheme enables fast rejection of the outliers in the sampled sets, resulting in high quality hypotheses. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, our proposed method serves as a generic framework which can be extended to problems with known correspondences.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SDRSAC:,Semidefinite-Based,Randomized,Approach,for,Robust,Point,Cloud,Registration,Without,Correspondences"
13,BAD SLAM: Bundle Adjusted Direct RGB-D SLAM,"A key component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems is the joint optimization of the estimated 3D map and camera trajectory. Bundle adjustment (BA) is the gold standard for this. Due to the large number of variables in dense RGB-D SLAM, previous work has focused on approximating BA. In contrast, in this paper we present a novel, fast direct BA formulation which we implement in a real-time dense RGB-D SLAM algorithm. In addition, we show that direct RGB-D SLAM systems are highly sensitive to rolling shutter, RGB and depth sensor synchronization, and calibration errors. In order to facilitate state-of-the-art research on direct RGB-D SLAM, we propose a novel, well-calibrated benchmark for this task that uses synchronized global shutter RGB and depth cameras. It includes a training set, a test set without public ground truth, and an online evaluation service. We observe that the ranking of methods changes on this dataset compared to existing ones, and our proposed algorithm outperforms all other evaluated SLAM methods.

14,Revealing Scenes by Inverting Structure From Motion Reconstructions,"Many 3D vision systems localize cameras within a scene using 3D point clouds. Such point clouds are often obtained using structure from motion (SfM), after which the images are discarded to preserve privacy. In this paper, we show, for the first time, that such point clouds retain enough information to reveal scene appearance and compromise privacy. We present a privacy attack that reconstructs color images of the scene from the point cloud. Our method is based on a cascaded U-Net that takes as input, a 2D multichannel image of the points rendered from a specific viewpoint containing point depth and optionally color and SIFT descriptors and outputs a color image of the scene from that viewpoint. Unlike previous feature inversion methods, we deal with highly sparse and irregular 2D point distributions and inputs where many point attributes are missing, namely keypoint orientation and scale, the descriptor image source and the 3D point visibility. We evaluate our attack algorithm on public datasets and analyze the significance of the point cloud attributes. Finally, we show that novel views can also be generated thereby enabling compelling virtual tours of the underlying scene.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Revealing,Scenes,by,Inverting,Structure,From,Motion,Reconstructions"
15,Strand-Accurate Multi-View Hair Capture,"Hair is one of the most challenging objects to reconstruct due to its micro-scale structure and a large number of repeated strands with heavy occlusions. In this paper, we present the first method to capture high-fidelity hair geometry with strand-level accuracy. Our method takes three stages to achieve this. In the first stage, a new multi-view stereo method with a slanted support line is proposed to solve the hair correspondences between different views. In detail, we contribute a novel cost function consisting of both photo-consistency term and geometric term that reconstructs each hair pixel as a 3D line. By merging all the depth maps, a point cloud, as well as local line directions for each point, is obtained. Thus, in the second stage, we feature a novel strand reconstruction method with the mean-shift to convert the noisy point data to a set of strands. Lastly, we grow the hair strands with multi-view geometric constraints to elongate the short strands and recover the missing strands, thus significantly increasing the reconstruction completeness. We evaluate our method on both synthetic data and real captured data, showing that our method can reconstruct hair strands with sub-millimeter accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Strand-Accurate,Multi-View,Hair,Capture"
16,DeepSDF: Learning Continuous Signed Distance Functions for Shape Representation,"Computer graphics, 3D computer vision and robotics communities have produced multiple approaches to representing 3D geometry for rendering and reconstruction. These provide trade-offs across fidelity, efficiency and compression capabilities. In this work, we introduce DeepSDF, a learned continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation of a class of shapes that enables high quality shape representation, interpolation and completion from partial and noisy 3D input data. DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart, represents a shape's surface by a continuous volumetric field: the magnitude of a point in the field represents the distance to the surface boundary and the sign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape, hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape's boundary as the zero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing the classification of space as being part of the shapes interior or not. While classical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class of shapes. Furthermore, we show state-of-the-art performance for learned 3D shape representation and completion while reducing the model size by an order of magnitude compared with previous work.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DeepSDF:,Learning,Continuous,Signed,Distance,Functions,for,Shape,Representation"
17,Pushing the Boundaries of View Extrapolation With Multiplane Images,"We explore the problem of view synthesis from a narrow baseline pair of images, and focus on generating high-quality view extrapolations with plausible disocclusions. Our method builds upon prior work in predicting a multiplane image (MPI), which represents scene content as a set of RGBA planes within a reference view frustum and renders novel views by projecting this content into the target viewpoints. We present a theoretical analysis showing how the range of views that can be rendered from an MPI increases linearly with the MPI disparity sampling frequency, as well as a novel MPI prediction procedure that theoretically enables view extrapolations of up to 4 times the lateral viewpoint movement allowed by prior work. Our method ameliorates two specific issues that limit the range of views renderable by prior methods: 1) We expand the range of novel views that can be rendered without depth discretization artifacts by using a 3D convolutional network architecture along with a randomized-resolution training procedure to allow our model to predict MPIs with increased disparity sampling frequency. 2) We reduce the repeated texture artifacts seen in disocclusions by enforcing a constraint that the appearance of hidden content at any depth must be drawn from visible content at or behind that depth.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pushing,the,Boundaries,of,View,Extrapolation,With,Multiplane,Images"
18,GA-Net: Guided Aggregation Net for End-To-End Stereo Matching,"In the stereo matching task, matching cost aggregation is crucial in both traditional methods and deep neural network models in order to accurately estimate disparities. We propose two novel neural net layers, aimed at capturing local and the whole-image cost dependencies respectively.  The first is a semi-global aggregation layer which is a differentiable approximation of the semi-global matching, the second is the local guided aggregation layer which follows a traditional cost filtering strategy to refine thin structures.  These two layers can be used to replace the widely used 3D convolutional layer which is computationally costly and memory-consuming as it has cubic computational/memory complexity. In the experiments, we show that nets with a two-layer guided aggregation block easily outperform the state-of-the-art GC-Net which has nineteen 3D convolutional layers. We also train a deep guided aggregation network (GA-Net) which gets better accuracies than state-of-the-art methods on both Scene Flow dataset and KITTI benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"GA-Net:,Guided,Aggregation,Net,for,End-To-End,Stereo,Matching"
19,Real-Time Self-Adaptive Deep Stereo,"Deep convolutional neural networks trained end-to-end are the state-of-the-art methods to regress dense disparity maps from stereo pairs. These models, however, suffer from a notable decrease in accuracy when exposed to scenarios significantly different from the training set (e.g., real vs synthetic images, etc.). We argue that it is extremely unlikely to gather enough samples to achieve effective training/tuning in any target domain, thus making this setup impractical for many applications. Instead, we propose to perform unsupervised and continuous online adaptation of a deep stereo network, which allows for preserving its accuracy in any environment. However, this strategy is extremely computationally demanding and thus prevents real-time inference. We address this issue introducing a new lightweight, yet effective, deep stereo architecture, Modularly ADaptive Network(MADNet), and developing a Modular ADaptation (MAD) algorithm, which independently trains sub-portions of the network. By deploying MADNet together with MAD we introduce the first real-time self-adaptive deep stereo system enabling competitive performance on heterogeneous datasets.

20,LAF-Net: Locally Adaptive Fusion Networks for Stereo Confidence Estimation,"We present a novel method that estimates confidence map of an initial disparity by making full use of tri-modal input, including matching cost, disparity, and color image through deep networks.  The proposed network, termed as Locally Adaptive Fusion Networks (LAF-Net), learns locally-varying attention and scale maps to fuse the tri-modal confidence features. The attention inference networks encode the importance of tri-modal confidence features and then concatenate them using the attention maps in an adaptive and dynamic fashion. This enables us to make an optimal fusion of the heterogeneous features, compared to a simple concatenation technique that is commonly used in conventional approaches. In addition, to encode the confidence features with locally-varying receptive fields, the scale inference networks learn the scale map and warp the fused confidence features through convolutional spatial transformer networks. Finally, the confidence map is progressively estimated in the recursive refinement networks to enforce a spatial context and local consistency. Experimental results show that this model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"LAF-Net:,Locally,Adaptive,Fusion,Networks,for,Stereo,Confidence,Estimation"
21,NM-Net: Mining Reliable Neighbors for Robust Feature Correspondences,"Feature correspondence selection is pivotal to many feature-matching based tasks in computer vision. Searching spatially k-nearest neighbors is a common strategy for extracting local information in many previous works. However, there is no guarantee that the spatially k-nearest neighbors of correspondences are consistent because the spatial distribution of false correspondences is often irregular. To address this issue, we present a compatibility-specific mining method to search for consistent neighbors. Moreover, in order to extract and aggregate more reliable features from neighbors, we propose a hierarchical network named NM-Net with a series of graph convolutions that is insensitive to the order of correspondences. Our experimental results have shown the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four datasets with various inlier ratios and varying numbers of feature consistencies.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"NM-Net:,Mining,Reliable,Neighbors,for,Robust,Feature,Correspondences"

Our approach is end-to-end, consisting of three modules: 3D scene volume reconstruction, 2D depth map inpainting, and multi-view selection for completion. Given a single depth image, our method first goes through the 3D volume branch to obtain a volumetric scene reconstruction as a guide to the next view inpainting step, which attempts to make up the missing information; the third step involves projecting the volume under the same view of the input, concatenating them to complete the current view depth, and integrating all depth into the point cloud. Since the occluded areas are unavailable, we resort to a deep Q-Network to glance around and pick the next best view for large hole completion progressively until a scene is adequately reconstructed while guaranteeing validity. All steps are learned jointly to achieve robust and consistent results. We perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations with extensive experiments on the SUNCG data, obtaining better results than the state of the art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Reinforcement,Learning,of,Volume-Guided,Progressive,View,Inpainting,for,3D,Point,Scene,Completion,From,a,Single,Depth,Image"

We repurpose a Transformer-style architecture to aggregate features from the spatiotemporal context around the person whose actions we are trying to classify. We show that by using high-resolution, person-specific, class-agnostic queries, the model spontaneously learns to track individual people and to pick up on semantic context from the actions of others. Additionally its attention mechanism learns to emphasize hands and faces, which are often crucial to discriminate an action - all without explicit supervision other than boxes and class labels. We train and test our Action Transformer network on the Atomic Visual Actions (AVA) dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a significant margin using only raw RGB frames as input.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Video,Action,Transformer,Network"

We revisit the conventional definition of activity and restrict it to Complex Action: a set of one-actions with a weak temporal pattern that serves a specific purpose. Related works use spatiotemporal 3D convolutions with fixed kernel size, too rigid to capture the varieties in temporal extents of complex actions, and too short for long-range temporal modeling. In contrast, we use multi-scale temporal convolutions, and we reduce the complexity of 3D convolutions. The outcome is Timeception convolution layers, which reasons about minute-long temporal patterns, a factor of 8 longer than best related works. As a result, Timeception achieves impressive accuracy in recognizing the human activities of Charades, Breakfast Actions and MultiTHUMOS. Further, we demonstrate that Timeception learns long-range temporal dependencies and tolerate temporal extents of complex actions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Timeception,for,Complex,Action,Recognition"
26,STEP: Spatio-Temporal Progressive Learning for Video Action Detection,"In this paper, we propose Spatio-TEmporal Progressive (STEP) action detector--a progressive learning framework for spatio-temporal action detection in videos. Starting from a handful of coarse-scale proposal cuboids, our approach progressively refines the proposals towards actions over a few steps. In this way, high-quality proposals (i.e., adhere to action movements) can be gradually obtained at later steps by leveraging the regression outputs from previous steps. At each step, we adaptively extend the proposals in time to incorporate more related temporal context. Compared to the prior work that performs action detection in one run, our progressive learning framework is able to naturally handle the spatial displacement within action tubes and therefore provides a more effective way for spatio-temporal modeling. We extensively evaluate our approach on UCF101 and AVA, and demonstrate superior detection results. Remarkably, we achieve mAP of 75.0% and 18.6% on the two datasets with 3 progressive steps and using respectively only 11 and 34 initial proposals.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"STEP:,Spatio-Temporal,Progressive,Learning,for,Video,Action,Detection"

More precisely, given a history of H previous frames, the goal is to detect actors and to predict their future actions for the next T frames. Our approach jointly models temporal and spatial interactions among different actors by constructing a recurrent graph, using actor proposals obtained with Faster R-CNN as nodes. Our method learns to select a subset of discriminative relations without requiring explicit supervision, thus enabling us  to tackle challenging visual data. We refer to our model as Discriminative Relational Recurrent Network (DRRN). Evaluation of action prediction on AVA  demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to simpler baselines.

29,Which Way Are You Going? Imitative Decision Learning for Path Forecasting in Dynamic Scenes,"Path forecasting is a pivotal step toward understanding dynamic scenes and an emerging topic in the computer vi- sion field. This task is challenging due to the multimodal nature of the future, namely, given a partial history, there is more than one plausible prediction. Yet, the state-of-the-art methods seem not fully responsive to this innate variabil- ity. Hence, how to better foresee the forthcoming trajectory in dynamic scenes has to be more thoroughly pursued. To this end, we propose a novel Imitative Decision Learning (IDL) approach. It delves deeper into the key that inher- ently characterizes the multimodality - the latent decision. The proposed IDL first infers the distribution of such latent decisions by learning from moving histories. A policy is then generated by taking the sampled latent decision into account to predict the future. Different plausible upcoming paths corresponds to each sampled latent decision. This ap- proach significantly differs from the mainstream literature that relies on a predefined latent variable to extrapolate di- verse predictions. In order to augment the understanding of the latent decision and resultant mutimodal future, we in- vestigate their connection through mutual information op- timization. Moreover, the proposed IDL integrates spatial and temporal dependencies into one single framework, in contrast to handling them with two-step settings. As a re- sult, our approach enables simultaneous anticipation of the paths of all pedestrians in the scene. We assess our pro- posal on the large-scale SAP, ETH and UCY datasets. The experiments show that IDL introduces considerable margin improvements with respect to recent leading studies.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Which,Way,Are,You,Going?,Imitative,Decision,Learning,for,Path,Forecasting,in,Dynamic,Scenes"
30,What and How Well You Performed? A Multitask Learning Approach to Action Quality Assessment,"Can performance on the task of action quality assessment (AQA) be improved by exploiting a description of the action and its quality? Current AQA and skills assessment approaches propose to learn features that serve only one task - estimating the final score. In this paper, we propose to learn spatio-temporal features that explain three related tasks - fine-grained action recognition, commentary generation, and estimating the AQA score. A new multitask-AQA dataset, the largest to date, comprising of 1412 diving samples was collected to evaluate our approach (http://rtis.oit.unlv.edu/datasets.html). We show that our MTL approach outperforms STL approach using two different kinds of architectures: C3D-AVG and MSCADC. The C3D-AVG-MTL approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance with a rank correlation of 90.44%. Detailed experiments were performed to show that MTL offers better generalization than STL, and representations from action recognition models are not sufficient for the AQA task and instead should be learned.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"What,and,How,Well,You,Performed?,A,Multitask,Learning,Approach,to,Action,Quality,Assessment"
31,MHP-VOS: Multiple Hypotheses Propagation for Video Object Segmentation,"We address the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS), where the masks of objects of interests are given in the first frame of an input video. To deal with challenging cases where objects are occluded or missing, previous work relies on greedy data association strategies that make decisions for each frame individually. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to defer the decision making for a target object in each frame, until a global view can be established with the entire video being taken into consideration. Our approach is in the same spirit as Multiple Hypotheses Tracking (MHT) methods, making several critical adaptations for the VOS problem. We employ the bounding box (bbox) hypothesis for tracking tree formation, and the multiple hypotheses are spawned by propagating the preceding bbox into the detected bbox proposals within a gated region starting from the initial object mask in the first frame. The gated region is determined by a gating scheme which takes into account a more comprehensive motion model rather than the simple Kalman filtering model in traditional MHT. To further design more customized algorithms tailored for VOS, we develop a novel mask propagation score instead of the appearance similarity score that could be brittle due to large deformations. The mask propagation score, together with the motion score, determines the affinity between the hypotheses during tree pruning. Finally, a novel mask merging strategy is employed to handle mask conflicts between objects. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in the case of object missing.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MHP-VOS:,Multiple,Hypotheses,Propagation,for,Video,Object,Segmentation"
32,2.5D Visual Sound,"Binaural audio provides a listener with 3D sound sensation, allowing a rich perceptual experience of the scene.  However, binaural recordings are scarcely available and require nontrivial expertise and equipment to obtain. We propose to convert common monaural audio into binaural audio by leveraging video. The key idea is that visual frames reveal significant spatial cues that, while explicitly lacking in the accompanying single-channel audio, are strongly linked to it. Our multi-modal approach recovers this link from unlabeled video.  We devise a deep convolutional neural network that learns to decode the monaural (single-channel) soundtrack into its binaural counterpart by injecting visual information about object and scene configurations. We call the resulting output 2.5D visual sound---the visual stream helps  ""lift"" the flat single channel audio into spatialized sound. In addition to sound generation, we show the self-supervised representation learned by our network benefits audio-visual source separation.

33,Language-Driven Temporal Activity Localization: A Semantic Matching Reinforcement Learning Model,"Current studies on action detection in untrimmed videos are mostly designed for action classes, where an action is described at word level such as jumping, tumbling, swing, etc. This paper focuses on a rarely investigated problem of localizing an activity via a sentence query which would be more challenging and practical. Considering that current methods are generally time-consuming due to the dense frame-processing manner, we propose a recurrent neural network based reinforcement learning model which selectively observes a sequence of frames and associates the given sentence with video content in a matching-based manner. However, directly matching sentences with video content performs poorly due to the large visual-semantic discrepancy. Thus, we extend the method to a semantic matching reinforcement learning (SM-RL) model  by extracting semantic concepts of videos and then fusing them with global context features. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, TACoS, Charades-STA and DiDeMo, show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a high detection speed, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Language-Driven,Temporal,Activity,Localization:,A,Semantic,Matching,Reinforcement,Learning,Model"
34,Gaussian Temporal Awareness Networks for Action Localization,"Temporally localizing actions in a video is a fundamental challenge in video understanding. Most existing approaches have often drawn inspiration from image object detection and extended the advances, e.g., SSD and Faster R-CNN, to produce temporal locations of an action in a 1D sequence. Nevertheless, the results can suffer from robustness problem due to the design of predetermined temporal scales, which overlooks the temporal structure of an action and limits the utility on detecting actions with complex variations. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by introducing Gaussian kernels to dynamically optimize temporal scale of each action proposal. Specifically, we present Gaussian Temporal Awareness Networks (GTAN) --- a new architecture that novelly integrates the exploitation of temporal structure into an one-stage action localization framework. Technically, GTAN models the temporal structure through learning a set of Gaussian kernels, each for a cell in the feature maps. Each Gaussian kernel corresponds to a particular interval of an action proposal and a mixture of Gaussian kernels could further characterize action proposals with various length. Moreover, the values in each Gaussian curve reflect the contextual contributions to the localization of an action proposal. Extensive experiments are conducted on both THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, GTAN achieves 1.9% and 1.1% improvements in mAP on testing set of the two datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Gaussian,Temporal,Awareness,Networks,for,Action,Localization"
35,Efficient Video Classification Using Fewer Frames,"Recently, there has been a lot of interest in building compact models for video classification which have a small memory footprint (<1 GB). While these models are compact, they typically operate by repeated application of a small weight matrix to all the frames in a video. For example, recurrent neural network based methods compute a hidden state for every frame of the video using a recurrent weight matrix. Similarly, cluster-and-aggregate based methods such as NetVLAD have a learnable clustering matrix which is used to assign soft-clusters to every frame in the video. Since these models look at every frame in the video, the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) is still large even though the memory footprint is small. In this work, we focus on building compute-efficient video classification models which process fewer frames and hence have less number of FLOPs. Similar to memory efficient models, we use the idea of distillation albeit in a different setting. Specifically, in our case, a compute-heavy teacher which looks at all the frames in the video is used to train a compute-efficient student which looks at only a small fraction of frames in the video. This is in contrast to a typical memory efficient Teacher-Student setting, wherein both the teacher and the student look at all the frames in the video but the student has fewer parameters. Our work thus complements the research on memory efficient video classification. We do an extensive evaluation with three types of models for video classification, viz., (i) recurrent models (ii) cluster-and-aggregate models and (iii) memory-efficient cluster-and-aggregate models and show that in each of these cases, a see-it-all teacher can be used to train a compute efficient see-very-little student.  Overall, we show that the proposed student network can reduce the inference time by 30% and the number of FLOPs by approximately 90% with a negligent drop in the performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Efficient,Video,Classification,Using,Fewer,Frames"
36,Parsing R-CNN for Instance-Level Human Analysis,"Instance-level human analysis is common in real-life scenarios and has multiple manifestations, such as human part segmentation, dense pose estimation, human-object interactions, etc. Models need to distinguish different human instances in the image panel and learn rich features to represent the details of each instance. In this paper, we present an end-to-end pipeline for solving the instance-level human analysis, named Parsing R-CNN. It processes a set of human instances simultaneously through comprehensive considering the characteristics of region-based approach and the appearance of a human, thus allowing representing the details of instances.     Parsing R-CNN is very flexible and efficient, which is applicable to many issues in human instance analysis. Our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on CIHP (Crowd Instance-level Human Parsing), MHP v2.0 (Multi-Human Parsing) and DensePose-COCO datasets. Based on the proposed Parsing R-CNN, we reach the 1st place in the COCO 2018 Challenge DensePose Estimation task. Code and models are publicly available.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Parsing,R-CNN,for,Instance-Level,Human,Analysis"
37,Large Scale Incremental Learning,"Modern machine learning suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes incrementally. The performance dramatically degrades due to the missing data of old classes. Incremental learning methods have been proposed to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, by using knowledge distilling and keeping a few exemplars from the old classes. However, these methods struggle to scale up to a large number of classes. We believe this is because of the combination of two factors:  (a) the data imbalance between the old and new classes, and (b) the increasing number of visually similar classes.     Distinguishing between an increasing number of visually similar classes is particularly challenging, when the training data is unbalanced.   We propose a simple and effective method to address this data imbalance issue. We found that the last fully connected layer has a strong bias towards the new classes, and this bias can be corrected by    a linear model. With two bias parameters, our method performs remarkably well on two large datasets: ImageNet (1000 classes) and MS-Celeb-1M (10000 classes), outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms by 11.1% and 13.2% respectively.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Large,Scale,Incremental,Learning"
38,TopNet: Structural Point Cloud Decoder,"3D point cloud generation is of great use for 3D scene modeling and understanding.  Real-world 3D object point clouds  can  be  properly  described  by  a  collection  of  low-level and high-level structures such as surfaces, geometric primitives, semantic parts,etc. In fact, there exist many different representations of a 3D object point cloud as a set of point groups.  Existing frameworks for point cloud genera-ion either do not consider structure in their proposed solutions, or assume and enforce a specific structure/topology,e.g.  a  collection  of  manifolds  or  surfaces,  for  the  generated  point  cloud  of  a  3D  object.   In  this  work,  we  pro-pose a novel decoder that generates a structured point cloud without assuming any specific structure or topology on the underlying point set.  Our decoder is softly constrained to generate a point cloud following a hierarchical rooted tree structure.  We show that given enough capacity and allowing for redundancies, the proposed decoder is very flexible and able to learn any arbitrary grouping of points including any topology on the point set.  We evaluate our decoder on the task of point cloud generation for 3D point cloud shape completion.  Combined with encoders from existing frameworks, we show that our proposed decoder significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 3D point cloud completion methods on the Shapenet dataset",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"TopNet:,Structural,Point,Cloud,Decoder"
39,Perceive Where to Focus: Learning Visibility-Aware Part-Level Features for Partial Person Re-Identification,"This paper considers a realistic problem in person re-identification (re-ID) task, i.e., partial re-ID. Under partial re-ID scenario, the images may contain a partial observation of a pedestrian. If we directly compare a partial pedestrian image with a holistic one, the extreme spatial misalignment significantly compromises the discriminative ability of the learned representation. We propose a Visibility-aware Part Model (VPM) for partial re-ID, which learns to perceive the visibility of regions through self-supervision. The visibility awareness allows VPM to extract region-level features and compare two images with focus on their shared regions (which are visible on both images). VPM gains two-fold benefit toward higher accuracy for partial re-ID. On the one hand, compared with learning a global feature, VPM learns region-level features and thus benefits from fine-grained information. On the other hand, with visibility awareness, VPM is capable to estimate the shared regions between two images and thus suppresses the spatial misalignment. Experimental results confirm that our method significantly improves the learned feature representation and the achieved accuracy is on par with the state of the art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Perceive,Where,to,Focus:,Learning,Visibility-Aware,Part-Level,Features,for,Partial,Person,Re-Identification"
40,Meta-Transfer Learning for Few-Shot Learning,"Meta-learning has been proposed as a framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting. The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, ""meta"" refers to training multiple tasks, and ""transfer"" is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Meta-Transfer,Learning,for,Few-Shot,Learning"
41,Structured Binary Neural Networks for Accurate Image Classification and Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with both binarized weights and activations, leading to quantized models specifically for mobile devices with limited power capacity and computation resources. By assuming the same architecture to full-precision networks, previous works on quantizing CNNs seek to preserve the floating-point information using a set of discrete values, which we call value approximation. However, we take a novel ""structure approximation"" view for quantization--- it is very likely that a different architecture may be better for best performance. In particular, we propose a ""network decomposition"" strategy, named Group-Net, in which we divide the network into groups. In this way, each full-precision group can be effectively reconstructed by aggregating a set of homogeneous binary branches.  In addition, we learn effect connections among groups to improve the representational capability. Moreover, the proposed Group-Net shows strong generalization to other tasks. For instance, we extend Group-Net for highly accurate semantic segmentation by embedding rich context into the binary structure. Experiments on both classification and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over various popular architectures. In particular, we outperform the previous best binary neural networks in terms of accuracy and huge computation saving.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Structured,Binary,Neural,Networks,for,Accurate,Image,Classification,and,Semantic,Segmentation"
42,Deep RNN Framework for Visual Sequential Applications,"Extracting temporal and representation features efficiently plays a pivotal role in understanding visual sequence information. To deal with this, we propose a new recurrent neural framework that can be stacked deep effectively. There are mainly two novel designs in our deep RNN framework: one is a new RNN module called Context Bridge Module (CBM) which splits the information flowing along the sequence (temporal direction) and along depth (spatial representation direction), making it easier to train when building deep by balancing these two directions; the other is the Overlap Coherence Training Scheme that reduces the training complexity for long visual sequential tasks on account of the limitation of computing resources.   We provide empirical evidence to show that our deep RNN framework is easy to optimize and can gain accuracy from the increased depth on several visual sequence problems. On these tasks, we evaluate our deep RNN framework with 15 layers, 7x than conventional RNN networks, but it is still easy to train. Our deep framework achieves more than 11% relative improvements over shallow RNN models on Kinetics, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 for video classification. For auxiliary annotation, after replacing the shallow RNN part of Polygon-RNN with our 15-layer deep CBM, the performance improves by 14.7%. For video future prediction, our deep RNN improves the state-of-the-art shallow model's performance by 2.4% on PSNR and SSIM.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,RNN,Framework,for,Visual,Sequential,Applications"
43,Graph-Based Global Reasoning Networks,"Globally modeling and reasoning over relations between regions can be beneficial for many computer vision tasks on both images and videos. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at modeling local relations by convolution operations, but they are typically inefficient at capturing global relations between distant regions and require stacking multiple convolution layers. In this work, we propose a new approach for reasoning globally in which a set of features are globally aggregated over the coordinate space and then projected to an interaction space where relational reasoning can be efficiently computed. After reasoning, relation-aware features are distributed back to the original coordinate space for down-stream tasks. We further present a highly efficient instantiation of the proposed approach and introduce the Global Reasoning unit (GloRe unit) that implements the coordinate-interaction space mapping by weighted global pooling and weighted broadcasting, and the relation reasoning via graph convolution on a small graph in interaction space. The proposed GloRe unit is lightweight, end-to-end trainable and can be easily plugged into existing CNNs for a wide range of tasks. Extensive experiments show our GloRe unit can consistently boost the performance of state-of-the-art backbone architectures, including ResNet, ResNeXt, SE-Net and DPN, for both 2D and 3D CNNs, on image classification, semantic segmentation and video action recognition task.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Graph-Based,Global,Reasoning,Networks"
44,SSN: Learning Sparse Switchable Normalization via SparsestMax,"Normalization methods improve both optimization and generalization of ConvNets. To further boost performance, the recently-proposed switchable normalization (SN) provides a new perspective for deep learning: it learns to select different normalizers for different convolution layers of a ConvNet. However, SN uses softmax function to learn importance ratios to combine normalizers, leading to redundant computations compared to a single normalizer.  This work addresses this issue by presenting Sparse Switchable Normalization (SSN) where the importance ratios are constrained to be sparse. Unlike l_1 and l_0 constraints that impose difficulties in optimization, we turn this constrained optimization problem into feed-forward computation by proposing SparsestMax, which is a sparse version of softmax. SSN has several appealing properties. (1) It inherits all benefits from SN such as applicability in various tasks and robustness to a wide range of batch sizes. (2) It is guaranteed to select only one normalizer for each normalization layer, avoiding redundant computations. (3) SSN can be transferred to various tasks in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments show that SSN outperforms its counterparts on various challenging benchmarks such as ImageNet, Cityscapes, ADE20K, and Kinetics.

Based on the fractal structure, a hierarchical feature learning framework together with an adaptive sphere projection module is proposed to learn deep feature in an end-to-end manner. Our framework not only inherits the strong representation power and generalization capability from convolutional neural networks for image recognition, but also extends CNN to learn robust feature resistant to rotations and perturbations. The proposed model is effective yet robust. Comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that our approach can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques on both 3D object classification and part segmentation tasks, meanwhile, outperform other rotation invariant models on rotated 3D object classification and retrieval tasks by a large margin.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spherical,Fractal,Convolutional,Neural,Networks,for,Point,Cloud,Recognition"
46,Learning to Generate Synthetic Data via Compositing,"We present a task-specific approach to synthetic data generation. Our framework employs a trainable synthesizer network that is optimized to produce meaningful training samples by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a 'target' classifier. The synthesizer and target networks are trained in an adversarial manner wherein each network is updated with a goal to outdo the other. Additionally, we ensure the synthesizer generates realistic data by pairing it with a discriminator trained on real-world images. Further, to make the target classifier invariant to blending artefacts, we introduce these artefacts to background regions of the training images so the target does not over-fit to them.  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to different target networks including a classification network on AffNIST [46], and two object detection networks (SSD, Faster-RCNN) on different datasets. On the AffNIST benchmark, our approach is able to surpass the baseline results with just half the training examples. On the VOC person detection benchmark, we show improvements of up to 2.7% as a result of our data augmentation. Similarly on the GMU detection benchmark, we report a performance boost of 3.5% in mAP over the baseline method, outperforming the previous state of the art approaches by as much as 7.5% in individual categories.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Generate,Synthetic,Data,via,Compositing"
47,Divide and Conquer the Embedding Space for Metric Learning,"Learning the embedding space, where semantically similar objects are located close together and  dissimilar objects far apart, is a cornerstone of many computer vision applications.  Existing approaches usually learn a single metric in the embedding space for all available data points, which may have a very complex non-uniform distribution with different notions of similarity between objects, e.g. appearance, shape, color or semantic meaning. Approaches for learning a single distance metric often struggle to encode all different types of relationships and do not  generalize well.  In this work, we propose a novel easy-to-implement divide and conquer approach for deep metric learning,  which significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of metric learning. Our approach utilizes the embedding space more efficiently by jointly splitting the embedding space and data into K smaller sub-problems.  It divides both, the data and the embedding space into K subsets and learns K separate distance metrics in the non-overlapping subspaces of the embedding space, defined by groups of neurons in the embedding layer of the neural network. The proposed approach increases the convergence speed and improves generalization since the complexity of each sub-problem is reduced compared to the original one. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin in retrieval, clustering and re-identification tasks on CUB200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, In-shop Clothes and PKU VehicleID datasets.

Despite its importance in different application settings, designing a novelty detector is utterly complex due to the unpredictable nature of novelties and its inaccessibility during the training procedure, factors which expose the unsupervised nature of the problem. In our proposal, we design a general unsupervised framework where we equip a deep autoencoder with a parametric density estimator that learns the probability distribution underlying the latent representations with an autoregressive procedure.  We show that a maximum likelihood objective, optimized in conjunction with the reconstruction of normal samples, effectively acts as a regularizer for the task at hand, by minimizing the differential entropy of the distribution spanned by latent vectors. In addition to providing a very general formulation, extensive experiments of our model on publicly available datasets deliver on-par or superior performances if compared to state-of-the-art methods in one-class and in video anomaly detection settings. Differently from our competitors, we remark that our proposal does not make any assumption about the nature of the novelties, making our work easily applicable to disparate contexts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Latent,Space,Autoregression,for,Novelty,Detection"

While various methods have been proposed for solving these including adversarial discriminator based methods, most approaches have focused on the entire image based domain adaptation. In an image, there would be regions that can be adapted better, for instance, the foreground object may be similar in nature. To obtain such regions, we propose methods that consider the probabilistic certainty estimate of various regions and specific focus on these during classification for adaptation. We observe that just by incorporating the probabilistic certainty of the discriminator while training the classifier, we are able to obtain state of the art results on various datasets as compared against all the recent methods. We provide a thorough empirical analysis of the method by providing ablation analysis, statistical significance test, and visualization of the attention maps and t-SNE embeddings.

This study suggests that adversarial perturbations on images lead to noise in the features constructed by these networks. Motivated by this observation, we develop new network architectures that increase adversarial robustness by performing feature denoising. Specifically, our networks contain blocks that denoise the features using non-local means or other filters; the entire networks are trained end-to-end. When combined with adversarial training, our feature denoising networks substantially improve the state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness in both white-box and black-box attack settings. On ImageNet, under 10-iteration PGD white-box attacks where prior art has 27.9% accuracy, our method achieves 55.7%; even under extreme 2000-iteration PGD white-box attacks, our method secures 42.6% accuracy.

It is well-known in the neuroscience community that  the receptive field size of visual cortical neurons are modulated by the stimulus, which has been rarely considered in constructing CNNs. We propose a dynamic selection mechanism in CNNs that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size based on multiple scales of input information. A building block called Selective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with different kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the information in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield different sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion layer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel Networks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show that SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower model complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture target objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons for adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.

This study allows new insight into the performance gap obeserved between adapative and non-adaptive gradient descent methods in practice. Further, analysis of the effect of training strategies and hyperparameters on the sparsity leads to practical suggestions in designing CNN training strategies enabling us to explore the tradeoffs between feature selectivity, network capacity, and generalization performance. Lastly, we show that the implicit sparsity can be harnessed for neural network speedup at par or better than explicit sparsification / pruning approaches, with no modifications to the typical training pipeline required.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"On,Implicit,Filter,Level,Sparsity,in,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"

Our network simultaneously learns deep hierarchical features of point clouds and flow embeddings that represent point motions, supported by two newly proposed learning layers for point sets. We evaluate the network on both challenging synthetic data from FlyingThings3D and real Lidar scans from KITTI. Trained on synthetic data only, our network successfully generalizes to real scans, outperforming various baselines and showing competitive results to the prior art.

In this paper, we go beyond global context and explore the fine-grained representation using co-occurrent features by introducing Co-occurrent Feature Model, which predicts the distribution of  co-occurrent features for a given target. To leverage the semantic context in the co-occurrent features, we build an Aggregated Co-occurrent Feature (ACF) Module by aggregating the probability of the co-occurrent feature with the co-occurrent context. ACF Module learns a fine-grained spatial invariant representation to capture co-occurrent context information across the scene. Our approach significantly improves the segmentation results using FCN and achieves superior performance 54.0% mIoU on Pascal Context, 87.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC 2012 and 44.89% mIoU on ADE20K datasets. The source code and complete system will be publicly available upon publication.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Co-Occurrent,Features,in,Semantic,Segmentation"
56,Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks,"Much of the recent progress made in image classification research can be credited to training procedure refinements,  such as changes in data augmentations and optimization methods. In the literature, however, most refinements are either briefly mentioned as implementation details or only visible in source code. In this paper, we will examine a collection of such refinements and empirically evaluate their impact on the final model accuracy through ablation study. We will show that, by combining these refinements together, we are able to improve various CNN models significantly. For example, we raise ResNet-50's top-1 validation accuracy from 75.3% to 79.29% on ImageNet. We will also demonstrate that improvement on image classification accuracy leads to better transfer learning performance in other application domains such as object detection and semantic segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bag,of,Tricks,for,Image,Classification,with,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"
57,Learning Channel-Wise Interactions for Binary Convolutional Neural Networks,"In this paper, we propose a channel-wise interaction based binary convolutional neural network learning method (CI-BCNN) for efficient inference. Conventional methods apply xnor and bitcount operations in binary convolution with notable quantization error, which usually obtains inconsistent signs in binary feature maps compared with their full-precision counterpart and leads to significant information loss. In contrast, our CI-BCNN mines the channel-wise interactions, through which prior knowledge is provided to alleviate inconsistency of signs in binary feature maps and preserves the information of input samples during inference. Specifically, we mine the channel-wise interactions by a reinforcement learning model, and impose channel-wise priors on the intermediate feature maps through the interacted bitcount function. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art binary convolutional neural networks with less computational and storage cost.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Channel-Wise,Interactions,for,Binary,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"
58,Knowledge Adaptation for Efficient Semantic Segmentation,"Both accuracy and efficiency are of significant importance to the task of semantic segmentation. Existing deep FCNs suffer from heavy computations due to a series of high-resolution feature maps for preserving the detailed knowledge in dense estimation. Although reducing the feature map resolution (i.e., applying a large overall stride) via subsampling operations (e.g., polling and convolution striding) can instantly increase the efficiency, it dramatically decreases the estimation accuracy. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a knowledge distillation method tailored for semantic segmentation to improve the performance of the compact FCNs with large overall stride. To handle the inconsistency between the features of the student and teacher network, we optimize the feature similarity in a transferred latent domain formulated by utilizing a pre-trained autoencoder. Moreover, an affinity distillation module is proposed to capture the long-range dependency by calculating the non local interactions across the whole image. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on three popular benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Cityscapes and Pascal Context. Built upon a highly competitive baseline, our proposed method can improve the performance of a student network by 2.5% (mIOU boosts from 70.2 to 72.7 on the cityscapes test set) and can train a better compact model with only 8% float operations (FLOPS) of a model that achieves comparable performances.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Knowledge,Adaptation,for,Efficient,Semantic,Segmentation"
59,Parametric Noise Injection: Trainable Randomness to Improve Deep Neural Network Robustness Against Adversarial Attack,"Recent developments in the field of Deep Learning have exposed the underlying vulnerability of Deep Neural Network (DNN) against adversarial examples. In image classification, an adversarial example is a carefully modified image that is visually imperceptible to the original image but can cause DNN model to misclassify it. Training the network with Gaussian noise is an effective technique to perform model regularization, thus improving model robustness against input variation. Inspired by this classical method, we explore to utilize the regularization characteristic of noise injection to improve DNN's robustness against adversarial attack. In this work, we propose Parametric-Noise-Injection (PNI) which involves trainable Gaussian noise injection at each layer on either activation or weights through solving the Min-Max optimization problem, embedded with adversarial training. These parameters are trained explicitly to achieve improved robustness.  The extensive results show that our proposed PNI technique effectively improves the robustness against a variety of powerful white-box and black-box attacks such as PGD, C&W, FGSM, transferable attack, and ZOO attack. Last but not the least, PNI method improves both clean- and perturbed-data accuracy, in comparison to the state-of-the-art defense methods, which outperforms current unbroken PGD defense by 1.1% and 6.8% on clean- and perturbed- test data respectively, using ResNet-20 architecture.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Parametric,Noise,Injection:,Trainable,Randomness,to,Improve,Deep,Neural,Network,Robustness,Against,Adversarial,Attack"
60,Invariance Matters: Exemplar Memory for Domain Adaptive Person Re-Identification,"This paper considers the domain adaptive person re-identification (re-ID) problem: learning a re-ID model from a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain. Conventional methods are mainly to reduce feature distribution gap between the source and target domains. However, these studies largely neglect the intra-domain variations in the target domain, which contain critical factors influencing the testing performance on the target domain. In this work, we comprehensively investigate into the intra-domain variations of the target domain and propose to generalize the re-ID model w.r.t three types of the underlying invariance, i.e., exemplar-invariance, camera-invariance and neighborhood-invariance. To achieve this goal, an exemplar memory is introduced to store features of the target domain and accommodate the three invariance properties. The memory allows us to enforce the invariance constraints over global training batch without significantly increasing computation cost. Experiment demonstrates that the three invariance properties and the proposed memory are indispensable towards an effective domain adaptation system. Results on three re-ID domains show that our domain adaptation accuracy outperforms the state of the art by a large margin.

61,Dissecting Person Re-Identification From the Viewpoint of Viewpoint,"Variations in visual factors such as viewpoint, pose, illumination and background, are usually viewed as important challenges in person re-identification (re-ID). In spite of acknowledging these factors to be influential, quantitative studies on how they affect a re-ID system are still lacking. To derive insights in this scientific campaign, this paper makes an early attempt in studying a particular factor, viewpoint. We narrow the viewpoint problem down to the pedestrian rotation angle to obtain focused conclusions. In this regard, this paper makes two contributions to the community. First, we introduce a large-scale synthetic data engine, PersonX. Composed of hand-crafted 3D person models, the salient characteristic of this engine is ""controllable"". That is, we are able to synthesize pedestrians by setting the visual variables to arbitrary values. Second, on the 3D data engine, we quantitatively analyze the influence of pedestrian rotation angle on re-ID accuracy. Comprehensively, the person rotation angles are precisely customized from 0 to 360, allowing us to investigate its effect on the training, query, and gallery sets. Extensive experiment helps us have a deeper understanding of the fundamental problems in person re-ID. Our research also provides useful insights for dataset building and future practical usage, e.g., a person of a side view makes a better query.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dissecting,Person,Re-Identification,From,the,Viewpoint,of,Viewpoint"
62,Learning to Reduce Dual-Level Discrepancy for Infrared-Visible Person Re-Identification,"Infrared-Visible person RE-IDentification (IV-REID) is a rising task. Compared to conventional person re-identification (re-ID), IV-REID concerns the additional modality discrepancy originated from the different imaging processes of spectrum cameras, in addition to the person's appearance discrepancy caused by viewpoint changes, pose variations and deformations presented in the conventional re-ID task. The co-existed discrepancies make IV-REID more difficult to solve. Previous methods attempt to reduce the appearance and modality discrepancies simultaneously using feature-level constraints. It is however difficult to eliminate the mixed discrepancies using only feature-level constraints. To address the problem, this paper introduces a novel Dual-level Discrepancy Reduction Learning (D^2RL) scheme which handles the two discrepancies separately. For reducing the modality discrepancy, an image-level sub-network is trained to translate an infrared image into its visible counterpart and a visible image to its infrared version. With the image-level sub-network, we can unify the representations for images with different modalities. With the help of the unified multi-spectral images, a feature-level sub-network is trained to reduce the remaining appearance discrepancy through feature embedding. By cascading the two sub-networks and training them jointly, the dual-level reductions take their responsibilities cooperatively and attentively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Reduce,Dual-Level,Discrepancy,for,Infrared-Visible,Person,Re-Identification"
63,Progressive Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a fully-unlabeled target domain. To tackle this task, recent approaches resort to discriminative domain transfer in virtue of  pseudo-labels to enforce the class-level distribution alignment across the source and target domains. These methods, however, are vulnerable to the error accumulation and thus incapable of preserving cross-domain category consistency, as the pseudo-labeling accuracy is not guaranteed explicitly. In this paper, we propose the Progressive Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) to align the discriminative features across domains progressively and effectively, via exploiting the intra-class variation in the target domain. To be specific, we first develop an Easy-to-Hard Transfer Strategy (EHTS) and an Adaptive Prototype Alignment (APA) step to train our model iteratively and alternatively. Moreover, upon observing that a good domain adaptation usually requires a non-saturated source classifier, we consider a simple yet efficient way to retard the convergence speed of the source classification loss by further involving a temperature variate into the soft-max function. The extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed PFAN exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on three UDA datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Progressive,Feature,Alignment,for,Unsupervised,Domain,Adaptation"
64,Feature-Level Frankenstein: Eliminating Variations for Discriminative Recognition,"Recent successes of deep learning-based recognition rely on maintaining the content related to the main-task label. However, how to explicitly dispel the noisy signals for better generalization remains an open issue. We systematically summarize the detrimental factors as task-relevant/irrelevant semantic variations and unspecified latent variation. In this paper, we cast these problems as an adversarial minimax game in the latent space. Specifically, we propose equipping an end-to-end conditional adversarial network with the ability to decompose an input sample into three complementary parts. The discriminative representation inherits the desired invariance property guided by prior knowledge of the task, which is marginally independent to the task-relevant/irrelevant semantic and latent variations. Our proposed framework achieves top performance on a serial of tasks, including digits recognition, lighting, makeup, disguise-tolerant face recognition, and facial attributes recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Feature-Level,Frankenstein:,Eliminating,Variations,for,Discriminative,Recognition"
65,Learning a Deep ConvNet for Multi-Label Classification With Partial Labels,"Deep ConvNets have shown great performance for single-label image classification (e.g. ImageNet), but it is necessary to move beyond the single-label classification task because pictures of everyday life are inherently multi-label. Multi-label classification is a more difficult task than single-label classification because both the input images and output label spaces are more complex. Furthermore, collecting clean multi-label annotations is more difficult to scale-up than single-label annotations. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose to train a model with partial labels i.e. only some labels are known per image. We first empirically compare different labeling strategies to show the potential for using partial labels on multi-label datasets. Then to learn with partial labels, we introduce a new classification loss that exploits the proportion of known labels per example. Our approach allows the use of the same training settings as when learning with all the annotations. We further explore several curriculum learning based strategies to predict missing labels. Experiments are performed on three large-scale multi-label datasets: MS COCO, NUS-WIDE and Open Images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,a,Deep,ConvNet,for,Multi-Label,Classification,With,Partial,Labels"
66,Generalized Intersection Over Union: A Metric and a Loss for Bounding Box Regression,"Intersection over Union (IoU) is the most popular evaluation metric used in the object detection benchmarks. However, there is a gap between optimizing the commonly used distance losses for regressing the parameters of a bounding box and maximizing this metric value. The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that IoU can be directly used as a regression loss. However, IoU has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the this weakness by introducing a generalized version of IoU as both a new loss and a new metric.  By incorporating this generalized IoU ( GIoU) as a loss into the state-of-the art object detection frameworks, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using both the standard, IoU based, and new, GIoU based, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generalized,Intersection,Over,Union:,A,Metric,and,a,Loss,for,Bounding,Box,Regression"
67,Densely Semantically Aligned Person Re-Identification,"We propose a densely semantically aligned person re-identification (re-ID) framework. It fundamentally addresses the body misalignment problem caused by pose/viewpoint variations, imperfect person detection, occlusion, etc.. By leveraging the estimation of the dense semantics of a person image, we construct a set of densely semantically aligned part images (DSAP-images), where the same spatial positions have the same semantics across different person images. We design a two-stream network that consists of a main full image stream (MF-Stream) and a densely semantically-aligned guiding stream (DSAG-Stream). The DSAG-Stream, with the DSAP-images as input, acts as a regulator to guide the MF-Stream to learn densely semantically aligned features from the original image. In the inference, the DSAG-Stream is discarded and only the MF-Stream is needed, which makes the inference system computationally efficient and robust. To our best knowledge, we are the first to make use of fine grained semantics for addressing misalignment problems for re-ID. Our method achieves rank-1 accuracy of 78.9% (new protocol) on the CUHK03 dataset, 90.4% on the CUHK01 dataset, and 95.7% on the Market1501 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Densely,Semantically,Aligned,Person,Re-Identification"
68,Generalising Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval,"Fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) addresses matching specific photo instance using free-hand sketch as a query modality. Existing models aim to learn an embedding space in which sketch and photo can be directly compared. While successful, they require instance-level pairing within each coarse-grained category as annotated training data. Since the learned embedding space is domain-specific, these models do not generalise well across categories. This limits the practical applicability of FG-SBIR. In this paper, we identify cross-category generalisation for FG-SBIR as a domain generalisation problem, and propose the first solution. Our key  contribution is a novel unsupervised learning approach to model a universal manifold of prototypical visual sketch traits. This manifold can then be used to paramaterise the learning of a sketch/photo representation. Model adaptation to novel categories then becomes automatic via embedding the novel sketch in the manifold and updating the representation and retrieval function accordingly. Experiments on the two largest FG-SBIR datasets, Sketchy and QMUL-Shoe-V2, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enabling cross-category generalisation of FG-SBIR.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generalising,Fine-Grained,Sketch-Based,Image,Retrieval"
69,Adapting Object Detectors via Selective Cross-Domain Alignment,"State-of-the-art object detectors are usually trained on public datasets. They often face substantial difficulties when applied to a different domain, where the imaging condition differs significantly and the corresponding annotated data are unavailable (or expensive to acquire). A natural remedy is to adapt the model by aligning the image representations on both domains. This can be achieved, for example, by adversarial learning, and has been shown to be effective in tasks like image classification. However, we found that in object detection, the improvement obtained in this way is quite limited. An important reason is that conventional domain adaptation methods strive to align images as a whole, while object detection, by nature, focuses on local regions that may contain objects of interest. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach to domain adaption for object detection to handle the issues in ""where to look"" and ""how to align"". Our key idea is to mine the discriminative regions, namely those that are directly pertinent to object detection, and focus on aligning them across both domains. Experiments show that the proposed method performs remarkably better than existing methods with about 4%   6% improvement under various domain-shift scenarios while keeping good scalability.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Adapting,Object,Detectors,via,Selective,Cross-Domain,Alignment"
70,Cyclic Guidance for Weakly Supervised Joint Detection and Segmentation,"Weakly supervised learning has attracted growing research attention due to the significant saving in annotation cost for tasks that require intra-image annotations, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. To this end, existing weakly supervised object detection and semantic segmentation approaches follow an iterative label mining and model training pipeline. However, such a self-enforcement pipeline makes both tasks easy to be trapped in local minimums. In this paper, we join weakly supervised object detection and segmentation tasks with a multi-task learning scheme for the first time, which uses their respective failure patterns to complement each other's learning. Such cross-task enforcement helps both tasks to leap out of their respective local minimums. In particular, we present an efficient and effective framework termed Weakly Supervised Joint Detection and Segmentation (WS-JDS). WS-JDS has two branches for the above two tasks, which share the same backbone network. In the learning stage, it uses the same cyclic training paradigm but with a specific loss function such that the two branches benefit each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the widely-used Pascal VOC and COCO benchmarks, which demonstrate that our model has achieved competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cyclic,Guidance,for,Weakly,Supervised,Joint,Detection,and,Segmentation"
71,Thinking Outside the Pool: Active Training Image Creation for Relative Attributes,"Current wisdom suggests more labeled image data is always better, and obtaining labels is the bottleneck. Yet curating a pool of sufficiently diverse and informative images is itself a challenge. In particular, training image curation is problematic for fine-grained attributes, where the subtle visual differences of interest may be rare within traditional image sources. We propose an active image generation approach to address this issue. The main idea is to jointly learn the attribute ranking task while also learning to generate novel realistic image samples that will benefit that task. We introduce an end-to-end framework that dynamically ""imagines"" image pairs that would confuse the current model, presents them to human annotators for labeling, then improves the predictive model with the new examples. On two datasets, we show that by thinking outside the pool of real images, our approach gains generalization accuracy on challenging fine-grained attribute comparisons.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Thinking,Outside,the,Pool:,Active,Training,Image,Creation,for,Relative,Attributes"
72,Generalizable Person Re-Identification by Domain-Invariant Mapping Network,"We aim to learn a domain generalizable person re-identification (ReID) model. When such a model is trained on a set of source domains (ReID datasets collected from different camera networks), it can be directly applied to any new unseen dataset for effective ReID without any model updating. Despite its practical value in real-world deployments, generalizable ReID has seldom been studied. In this work, a novel deep ReID model termed Domain-Invariant Mapping Network (DIMN) is proposed. DIMN is designed to learn a  mapping between a person image and its identity classifier, i.e., it produces a classifier using a single shot. To make the model domain-invariant, we follow a meta-learning pipeline and sample a subset of source domain training tasks during each training episode. However, the model is significantly different  from conventional meta-learning methods in that: (1) no model updating is required for the target domain, (2) different training tasks share a memory bank for maintaining both scalability and discrimination ability, and (3) it can be used to match an arbitrary  number of identities  in a target domain. Extensive experiments on a newly proposed large-scale ReID domain generalization benchmark show that our DIMN significantly outperforms alternative domain generalization or meta-learning methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generalizable,Person,Re-Identification,by,Domain-Invariant,Mapping,Network"
73,Visual Attention Consistency Under Image Transforms for Multi-Label Image Classification,"Human visual perception shows good consistency for many multi-label image classification tasks under certain spatial transforms, such as scaling, rotation, flipping and translation. This has motivated the data augmentation strategy widely used in CNN classifier training -- transformed images are included for training by assuming the same class labels as their original images. In this paper, we further propose the assumption of perceptual consistency of visual attention regions for classification under such transforms, i.e., the attention region for a classification follows the same transform if the input image is spatially transformed. While the attention regions of CNN classifiers can be derived as an attention heatmap in middle layers of the network, we find that their consistency under many transforms are not preserved.  To address this problem, we propose a two-branch network with an original image and its transformed image as inputs and introduce a new attention consistency loss that measures the attention heatmap consistency between two branches. This new loss is then combined with multi-label image classification loss for network training. Experiments on three datasets verify the superiority of the proposed network by achieving new state-of-the-art classification performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Visual,Attention,Consistency,Under,Image,Transforms,for,Multi-Label,Image,Classification"

While the re-ranking step is involved by running a diffusion process on the underlying data manifolds, the fusion step can leverage the complementarity of multiple metrics.   We give a comprehensive summary of existing fusion with diffusion strategies, and systematically analyze their pros and cons. Based on the analysis, we propose a unified yet robust algorithm which inherits their advantages and discards their disadvantages. Hence, we call it Unified Ensemble Diffusion (UED). More interestingly, we derive that the inherited properties indeed stem from a theoretical framework, where the relevant works can be elegantly summarized as special cases of UED by imposing additional constraints on the objective function and varying the solver of similarity propagation. Extensive experiments with 3D shape retrieval, image retrieval and person re-identification demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state of the arts, and at the same time suggest that re-ranking via metric fusion is a promising tool to further improve the retrieval performance of existing algorithms.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Re-Ranking,via,Metric,Fusion,for,Object,Retrieval,and,Person,Re-Identification"
75,Unsupervised Open Domain Recognition by Semantic Discrepancy Minimization,"We address the unsupervised open domain recognition (UODR) problem, where categories in labeled source domain S is only a subset of those in unlabeled target domain T. The task is to correctly classify all samples in T including known and unknown categories. UODR is challenging due to the domain discrepancy, which becomes even harder to bridge when a large number of unknown categories exist in T. Moreover, the classification rules propagated by graph CNN (GCN) may be distracted by unknown categories and lack generalization capability.         To measure the domain discrepancy for asymmetric label space between S and T, we propose Semantic-Guided Matching Discrepancy (SGMD), which first employs instance matching between S and T, and then the discrepancy is measured by a weighted feature distance between matched instances. We further design a limited balance constraint to achieve a more balanced classification output on known and unknown categories. We develop Unsupervised Open Domain Transfer Network (UODTN), which learns both the backbone classification network and GCN jointly by reducing the SGMD, enforcing the limited balance constraint and minimizing the classification loss on S. UODTN better preserves the semantic structure and enforces the consistency between the learned domain invariant visual features and the semantic embeddings.

76,Weakly Supervised Person Re-Identification,"In the conventional person re-id setting, it is assumed that the labeled images are the person images within the bounding box for each individual; this labeling across multiple nonoverlapping camera views from raw video surveillance is costly and time-consuming. To overcome this difficulty, we consider weakly supervised person re-id modeling. The weak setting refers to matching a target person with an untrimmed gallery video where we only know that the identity appears in the video without the requirement of annotating the identity in any frame of the video during the training procedure. Hence, for a video, there could be multiple video-level labels. We cast this weakly supervised person re-id challenge into a multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) problem. In particular, we develop a Cross-View MIML (CV-MIML) method that is able to explore potential intraclass person images from all the camera views by incorporating the intra-bag alignment and the cross-view bag alignment. Finally, the CV-MIML method is embedded into an existing deep neural network for developing the Deep Cross-View MIML (Deep CV-MIML) model. We have performed extensive experiments to show the feasibility of the proposed weakly supervised setting and verify the effectiveness of our method compared to related methods on four weakly labeled datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly,Supervised,Person,Re-Identification"

Instead of generating proposals from RGB image or projecting point cloud to bird's view or voxels as previous methods do, our stage-1 sub-network directly generates a small number of high-quality 3D proposals from point cloud in a bottom-up manner via segmenting the point cloud of the whole scene into foreground points and background. The stage-2 sub-network transforms the pooled points of each proposal to canonical coordinates to learn better local spatial features, which is combined with global semantic features of each point learned in stage-1 for accurate box refinement and confidence prediction. Extensive experiments on the 3D detection benchmark of KITTI dataset show that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods with remarkable margins by using only point cloud as input.

78,Automatic Adaptation of Object Detectors to New Domains Using Self-Training,"This work addresses the unsupervised adaptation of an existing object detector to a new target domain. We assume that a large number of unlabeled videos from this domain are readily available. We automatically obtain labels on the target data by using high-confidence detections from the existing detector, augmented with hard (misclassified) examples acquired by exploiting temporal cues using a tracker. These automatically-obtained labels are then used for re-training the original model. A modified knowledge distillation loss is proposed, and we investigate several ways of assigning soft-labels to the training examples from the target domain. Our approach is empirically evaluated on challenging face and pedestrian detection tasks: a face detector trained on WIDER-Face, which consists of high-quality images crawled from the web, is adapted to a large-scale surveillance  data set; a pedestrian detector trained on clear, daytime images from the BDD-100K driving data set is adapted to all other scenarios such as rainy, foggy, night-time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of incorporating hard examples obtained from tracking, the advantage of using soft-labels via distillation loss versus hard-labels, and show promising performance as a simple method for unsupervised domain adaptation of object detectors, with minimal dependence on hyper-parameters.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Automatic,Adaptation,of,Object,Detectors,to,New,Domains,Using,Self-Training"

Firstly, we propose an intuitive 3D shape representation method to deal with unaligned shapes with arbitrary poses. Specifically, the proposed Segmented Stochastic-viewing Shape Network models discriminative 3D representations by a set of 2D images rendered from multiple views, which are stochastically selected from non-overlapping spatial segments of a 3D sphere. Secondly, Batch-Hard Binary Coding (BHBC) is developed to learn semantics-preserving compact binary codes by mining the hardest samples. The overall framework is jointly learned by developing an alternating iteration algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a novel model that provides a unified framework for three different approaches: visual->semantic mapping, semantic->visual mapping, and metric learning. Specifically, our proposed model consists of a feature generator that can generate various visual features given class embeddings as input, a regressor that maps each visual feature back to its corresponding class embedding, and a discriminator that learns to evaluate the closeness of an image feature and a class embedding. All three components are trained under the combination of cyclic consistency loss and dual adversarial loss.

81,Query-Guided End-To-End Person Search,"Person search has recently gained attention as the novel task of finding a person, provided as a cropped sample, from a gallery of non-cropped images, whereby several other people are also visible. We believe that i. person detection and re-identification should be pursued in a joint optimization framework and that ii. the person search should leverage the query image extensively (e.g. emphasizing unique query patterns). However, so far, no prior art realizes this. We introduce a novel query-guided end-to-end person search network (QEEPS) to address both aspects. We leverage a most recent joint detector and re-identification work, OIM [37]. We extend this with i. a query-guided Siamese squeeze-and-excitation network (QSSE-Net) that uses global context from both the query and gallery images, ii. a query-guided region proposal network (QRPN) to produce query-relevant proposals, and iii. a query-guided similarity subnetwork (QSimNet), to learn a query-guided re-identification score. QEEPS is the first end-to-end query-guided detection and re-id network. On both the most recent CUHK-SYSU [37] and PRW [46] datasets, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Query-Guided,End-To-End,Person,Search"
82,Libra R-CNN: Towards Balanced Learning for Object Detection,"Compared with model architectures, the training process, which is also crucial to the success of detectors, has received relatively less attention in object detection. In this work, we carefully revisit the standard training practice of detectors, and find that the detection performance is often limited by the imbalance during the training process, which generally consists in three levels - sample level, feature level, and objective level. To mitigate the adverse effects caused thereby, we propose Libra R-CNN, a simple but effective framework towards balanced learning for object detection. It integrates three novel components: IoU-balanced sampling, balanced feature pyramid, and balanced L1 loss, respectively for reducing the imbalance at sample, feature, and objective level. Benefitted from the overall balanced design, Libra R-CNN significantly improves the detection performance. Without bells and whistles, it achieves 2.5 points and 2.0 points higher Average Precision (AP) than FPN Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet respectively on MSCOCO.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Libra,R-CNN:,Towards,Balanced,Learning,for,Object,Detection"
83,Learning a Unified Classifier Incrementally via Rebalancing,"Conventionally, deep neural networks are trained offline, relying on a large dataset prepared in advance. This paradigm is often challenged in real-world applications, e.g. online services that involve continuous streams of incoming data. Recently, incremental learning receives increasing attention, and is considered as a promising solution to the practical challenges mentioned above. However, it has been observed that incremental learning is subject to a fundamental difficulty -- catastrophic forgetting, namely adapting a model to new data often results in severe performance degradation on previous tasks or classes. Our study reveals that the imbalance between previous and new data is a crucial cause to this problem. In this work, we develop a new framework for incrementally learning a unified classifier, e.g. a classifier that treats both old and new classes uniformly. Specifically, we incorporate three components, cosine normalization, less-forget constraint, and inter-class separation, to mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively rebalance the training process, thus obtaining superior performance compared to the existing methods. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, our method can reduce the classification errors by more than 6% and 13% respectively, under the incremental setting of 10 phases.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,a,Unified,Classifier,Incrementally,via,Rebalancing"
84,Feature Selective Anchor-Free Module for Single-Shot Object Detection,"We motivate and present feature selective anchor-free (FSAF) module, a simple and effective building block for single-shot object detectors. It can be plugged into single-shot detectors with feature pyramid structure. The FSAF module addresses two limitations brought up by the conventional anchor-based detection: 1) heuristic-guided feature selection; 2) overlap-based anchor sampling. The general concept of the FSAF module is online feature selection applied to the training of multi-level anchor-free branches. Specifically, an anchor-free branch is attached to each level of the feature pyramid, allowing box encoding and decoding in the anchor-free manner at an arbitrary level. During training, we dynamically assign each instance to the most suitable feature level. At the time of inference, the FSAF module can work independently or jointly with anchor-based branches. We instantiate this concept with simple implementations of anchor-free branches and online feature selection strategy. Experimental results on the COCO detection track show that our FSAF module performs better than anchor-based counterparts while being faster. When working jointly with anchor-based branches, the FSAF module robustly improves the baseline RetinaNet by a large margin under various settings, while introducing nearly free inference overhead. And the resulting best model can achieve a state-of-the-art 44.6% mAP, outperforming all existing single-shot detectors on COCO.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Feature,Selective,Anchor-Free,Module,for,Single-Shot,Object,Detection"
85,Bottom-Up Object Detection by Grouping Extreme and Center Points,"With the advent of deep learning, object detection drifted from a bottom-up to a top-down recognition problem. State of the art algorithms enumerate a near-exhaustive list of object locations and classify each into: object or not. In this paper, we show that bottom-up approaches still perform competitively. We detect four extreme points (top-most, left-most, bottom-most, right-most) and one center point of objects using a standard keypoint estimation network. We group the five keypoints into a bounding box if they are geometrically aligned. Object detection is then a purely appearance-based keypoint estimation problem, without region classification or implicit feature learning. The proposed method performs on-par with the state-of-the-art region based detection methods, with a bounding box AP of 43.7% on COCO test-dev. In addition, our estimated extreme points directly span a coarse octagonal mask, with a COCO Mask AP of 18.9%, much better than the Mask AP of vanilla bounding boxes. Extreme point guided segmentation further improves this to 34.6% Mask AP.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bottom-Up,Object,Detection,by,Grouping,Extreme,and,Center,Points"
86,Feature Distillation: DNN-Oriented JPEG Compression Against Adversarial Examples,"Image compression-based approaches for defending against the adversarial-example attacks, which threaten the safety use of deep neural networks (DNN), have been investigated recently. However, prior works mainly rely on directly tuning parameters like compression rate, to blindly reduce image features, thereby lacking guarantee on both defense efficiency (i.e. accuracy of polluted images) and classification accuracy of benign images, after applying defense methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a JPEG-based defensive compression framework, namely ""feature distillation"", to effectively rectify adversarial examples without impacting classification accuracy on benign data. Our framework significantly escalates the defense efficiency with marginal accuracy reduction using a twostep method: First, we maximize malicious features filtering of adversarial input perturbations by developing defensive quantization in frequency domain of JPEG compression or decompression, guided by a semi-analytical method; Second, we suppress the distortions of benign features to restore classification accuracy through a DNN-oriented quantization refine process. Our experimental results show that proposed ""feature distillation"" can significantly surpass the latest input-transformation based mitigations such as Quilting and TV Minimization in three aspects, including defense efficiency (improve classification accuracy from   20% to   90% on adversarial examples), accuracy of benign images after defense (<= 1% accuracy degradation), and processing time per image (  259x Speedup). Moreover, our solution also can provide the best defense efficiency (  60% accuracy) against the latest BPDA attack with least accuracy reduction (  1%) on benign images among all other input-transformation based defense methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Feature,Distillation:,DNN-Oriented,JPEG,Compression,Against,Adversarial,Examples"
87,SCOPS: Self-Supervised Co-Part Segmentation,"Parts provide a good intermediate representation of objects that is robust with respect to camera, pose and appearance variations. Existing work on part segmentation is dominated by supervised approaches that rely on large amounts of manual annotations and also can not generalize to unseen object categories. We propose a self-supervised deep learning approach for part segmentation, where we devise several loss functions that aids in predicting part segments that are geometrically concentrated, robust to object variations and are also semantically consistent across different object instances. Extensive experiments on different types of image collections demonstrate that our approach can produce part segments that adhere to object boundaries and also more semantically consistent across object instances compared to existing self-supervised techniques.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SCOPS:,Self-Supervised,Co-Part,Segmentation"

A deep neural network is trained to predict the optical flow in a region using information from everywhere else but that region (context), while another network attempts to make such context as uninformative as possible. The result is a model where hypotheses naturally compete with no need for explicit regularization or hyper-parameter tuning. Although our method requires no supervision whatsoever, it outperforms several methods that are pre-trained on large annotated datasets. Our model can be thought of as a generalization of classical variational generative region-based segmentation, but in a way that avoids explicit regularization or solution of partial differential equations at run-time.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Moving,Object,Detection,via,Contextual,Information,Separation"
89,Pose2Seg: Detection Free Human Instance Segmentation,"The standard approach to image instance segmentation is to perform the object detection first, and then segment the object from the detection bounding-box. More recently, deep learning methods like Mask R-CNN perform them jointly. However, little research takes into account the uniqueness of the ""human"" category, which can be well defined by the pose skeleton. Moreover, the human pose skeleton can be used to better distinguish instances with heavy occlusion than using bounding-boxes. In this paper, we present a brand new pose-based instance segmentation framework for humans which separates instances based on human pose, rather than proposal region detection. We demonstrate that our pose-based framework can achieve better accuracy than the state-of-art detection-based approach on the human instance segmentation problem, and can moreover better handle occlusion. Furthermore, there are few public datasets containing many heavily occluded humans along with comprehensive annotations, which makes this a challenging problem seldom noticed by researchers. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a new benchmark ""Occluded Human (OCHuman)"", which focuses on occluded humans with comprehensive annotations including bounding-box, human pose and instance masks.  This dataset contains 8110 detailed annotated human instances within 4731 images. With an average 0.67 MaxIoU for each person, OCHuman is the most complex and challenging dataset related to human instance segmentation. Through this dataset, we want to emphasize occlusion as a challenging problem for researchers to study.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pose2Seg:,Detection,Free,Human,Instance,Segmentation"

However, with the limited stereo data available in the existing datasets and unstable ranging precision of current stereo methods, industry-level stereo matching in autonomous driving remains challenging. In this paper, we construct a novel large-scale stereo dataset named DrivingStereo. It contains over 180k images covering a diverse set of driving scenarios, which is hundreds of times larger than the KITTI Stereo dataset. High-quality labels of disparity are produced by a model-guided filtering strategy from multi-frame LiDAR points. For better evaluations, we present two new metrics for stereo matching in the driving scenes, i.e. a distance-aware metric and a semantic-aware metric. Extensive experiments show that compared with the models trained on FlyingThings3D or Cityscapes, the models trained on our DrivingStereo achieve higher generalization accuracy in real-world driving scenes, while the proposed metrics better evaluate the stereo methods on all-range distances and across different classes.

92,A Dataset and Benchmark for Large-Scale Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing,"Face anti-spoofing is essential to prevent face recognition systems from a security breach. Much of the progresses have been made by the availability of face anti-spoofing benchmark datasets in recent years. However, existing face anti-spoofing benchmarks have limited number of subjects (<=170) and modalities (<=2), which hinder the further development of the academic community. To facilitate face anti-spoofing research, we introduce a large-scale multi-modal dataset, namely CASIA-SURF, which is the largest publicly available dataset for face anti-spoofing in terms of both subjects and visual modalities. Specifically, it consists of 1,000 subjects with 21,000 videos and each sample has 3 modalities (i.e., RGB, Depth and IR). We also provide a measurement set, evaluation protocol and training/validation/testing subsets, developing a new benchmark for face anti-spoofing. Moreover, we present a new multi-modal fusion method as baseline, which performs feature re-weighting to select the more informative channel features while suppressing the less useful ones for each modal.

93,Unsupervised Learning of Consensus Maximization for 3D Vision Problems,"Consensus maximization is a key strategy in 3D vision for robust geometric model estimation from measurements with outliers. Generic methods for consensus maximization, such as Random Sampling and Consensus (RANSAC), have played a tremendous role in the success of 3D vision, in spite of the ubiquity of outliers. However, replicating the same generic behaviour in a deeply learned architecture, using supervised approaches, has proven to be difficult. In that context, unsupervised methods have a huge potential to adapt to any unseen data distribution, and therefore are highly desirable.  In this paper, we propose for the first time an unsupervised learning framework for consensus maximization, in the context of solving 3D vision problems. For that purpose, we establish a relationship between inlier measurements, represented by an ideal of inlier set, and the subspace of polynomials representing the space of target transformations. Using this relationship, we derive a constraint that must be satisfied  by the sought inlier set. This constraint can be tested without knowing the transformation parameters, therefore allows us to efficiently define the geometric model fitting cost. This model fitting cost is used as a supervisory signal for learning consensus maximization, where the learning process seeks for the largest measurement set that minimizes the proposed model fitting cost. Using our method, we solve a diverse set of 3D vision problems, including 3D-3D matching, non-rigid 3D shape matching with piece-wise rigidity and image-to-image matching. Despite being unsupervised, our method outperforms RANSAC in all three tasks for several datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Learning,of,Consensus,Maximization,for,3D,Vision,Problems"

In this paper, we propose an effective plug-and-play module called the structural relation network (SRN) to reason about the structural dependencies of local regions in 3D point clouds. Existing network architectures on point sets such as PointNet++ capture local structures individually, without considering their inner interactions. Instead, our SRN simultaneously exploits local information by modeling their geometrical and locational relations, which play critical roles for our humans to understand 3D objects. The proposed SRN module is simple, interpretable, and does not require any additional supervision signals, which can be easily equipped with the existing networks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate promising boosts on the tasks of 3D point cloud classification and segmentation by capturing structural relations with the SRN module.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Structural,Relational,Reasoning,of,Point,Clouds"
96,MVF-Net: Multi-View 3D Face Morphable Model Regression,"We address the problem of recovering the 3D geometry of a human face from a set of facial images in multiple views. While recent studies have shown impressive progress in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based facial reconstruction, the settings are mostly restricted to a single view. There is an inherent drawback in the single-view setting: the lack of reliable 3D constraints can cause unresolvable ambiguities.  We in this paper explore 3DMM-based shape recovery in a different setting, where a set of multi-view facial images are given as input. A novel approach is proposed to regress 3DMM parameters from multi-view inputs with an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Multi-view geometric constraints are incorporated into the network by establishing dense correspondences between different views leveraging a novel self-supervised view alignment loss. The main ingredient of the view alignment loss is a differentiable dense optical flow estimator that can backpropagate the alignment errors between an input view and a synthetic rendering from another input view, which is projected to the target view through the 3D shape to be inferred. Through minimizing the view alignment loss, better 3D shapes can be recovered such that the synthetic projections from one view to another can better align with the observed image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other 3DMM methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MVF-Net:,Multi-View,3D,Face,Morphable,Model,Regression"

We pose this as a piecewise image alignment problem for each mesh face projection. Our approach allows us to update shape parameters from the photometric error without any depth or mask information. Moreover, we show how to avoid a degeneracy of zero photometric gradients via rasterizing from a virtual viewpoint.

However, deep networks suffer from significant drops in accuracy when dealing with new environments. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Guided Stereo Matching, a novel paradigm leveraging a small amount of sparse, yet reliable depth measurements retrieved from an external source enabling to ameliorate this weakness. The additional sparse cues required by our method can be obtained with any strategy (e.g., a LiDAR) and used to enhance features linked to corresponding disparity hypotheses. Our formulation is general and fully differentiable, thus enabling to exploit the additional sparse inputs in pre-trained deep stereo networks as well as for training a new instance from scratch. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets and two state-of-the-art deep architectures show that even with a small set of sparse input cues, i) the proposed paradigm enables significant improvements to pre-trained networks. Moreover, ii) training from scratch notably increases accuracy and robustness to domain shifts.

100,Modeling Local Geometric Structure of 3D Point Clouds Using Geo-CNN,"Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have motivated researchers to adapt CNNs to directly model points in 3D point clouds. Modeling local structure has been proven to be important for the success of convolutional architectures, and researchers exploited the modeling of local point sets in the feature extraction hierarchy. However, limited attention has been paid to explicitly model the geometric structure amongst points in a local region. To address this problem, we propose Geo-CNN, which applies a generic convolution-like operation dubbed as GeoConv to each point and its local neighborhood. Local geometric relationships among points are captured when extracting edge features between the center and its neighboring points. We first decompose the edge feature extraction process onto three orthogonal bases, and then aggregate the extracted features based on the angles between the edge vector and the bases. This encourages the network to preserve the geometric structure in Euclidean space throughout the feature extraction hierarchy. GeoConv is a generic and efficient operation that can be easily integrated into 3D point cloud analysis pipelines for multiple applications.

Leveraging the off-the-shelf 2D object detector, we propose an artful approach to efficiently obtain a coarse cuboid for each predicted 2D box. The coarse cuboid has enough accuracy to guide us to determine the 3D box of the object by refinement. In contrast to previous state-of-the-art methods that only use the features extracted from the 2D bounding box for box refinement, we explore the 3D structure information of the object by employing the visual features of visible surfaces. The new features from surfaces are utilized to eliminate the problem of representation ambiguity brought by only using 2D bounding box. Moreover, we investigate different methods of 3D box refinement and discover that a classification formulation with quality aware loss have much better performance than regression.

Most recent approaches leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and achieve promising results. However, these methods are limited to detecting a fixed number of planes with certain learned order. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel two-stage method based on associative embedding, inspired by its recent success in instance segmentation. In the first stage, we train a CNN to map each pixel to an embedding space where pixels from the same plane instance have similar embeddings. Then, the plane instances are obtained by grouping the embedding vectors in planar regions via an efficient mean shift clustering algorithm. In the second stage, we estimate the parameter for each plane instance by considering both pixel-level and instance-level consistencies. With the proposed method, we are able to detect an arbitrary number of planes. Extensive experiments on public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, our method runs at 30 fps at the testing time, thus could facilitate many real-time applications such as visual SLAM and human-robot interaction.

The designed post-processing procedure for recovering 3D room layouts from 1D predictions can automatically infer the room shape with low computation cost--it takes less than 20ms for a panorama image while prior works might need dozens of seconds. We also propose Pano Stretch Data Augmentation, which can diversify panorama data and be applied to other panorama-related learning tasks.

We first regress the dimension and orientation of the object using an anchor-based method so that a suitable 3D proposal can be constructed. We propose FQNet, which can infer the 3D IoU between the 3D proposals and the object solely based on 2D cues. Therefore, during the detection process, we sample a large number of candidates in the 3D space and project these 3D bounding boxes on 2D image individually. The best candidate can be picked out by simply exploring the spatial overlap between proposals and the object, in the form of the output 3D IoU score of FQNet.

We adopt a compact parametric 3D hand model that represents deformable and articulated hand meshes. To achieve the model fitting to RGB images, we investigate and contribute in three ways: 1) Neural rendering: inspired by recent work on human body, our hand mesh estimator (HME) is implemented by a neural network and a differentiable renderer, supervised by 2D segmentation masks and 3D skeletons. HME demonstrates good performance for estimating diverse hand shapes and improves pose estimation accuracies. 2) Iterative testing refinement: Our fitting function is differentiable. We iteratively refine the initial estimate using the gradients, in the spirit of iterative model fitting methods like ICP. The idea is supported by the latest research on human body. 3) Self-data augmentation: collecting sized RGB-mesh (or segmentation mask)-skeleton triplets for training is a big hurdle. Once the model is successfully fitted to input RGB images, its meshes i.e. shapes and articulations, are realistic, and we augment view-points on top of estimated dense hand poses. Experiments using three RGB-based benchmarks show that our framework offers beyond state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D pose estimation, as well as recovers dense 3D hand shapes.

Various weakly or self supervised pose estimation methods have been proposed due to lack of 3D data. Nevertheless, these methods, in addition to 2D ground-truth poses, require either additional supervision in various forms (e.g. unpaired 3D ground truth data, a small subset of labels) or the camera parameters in multiview settings. To address these problems, we present EpipolarPose, a self-supervised learning method for 3D human pose estimation, which does not need  any 3D ground-truth data or camera extrinsics. During training, EpipolarPose estimates 2D poses from multi-view images, and then, utilizes epipolar geometry to obtain a 3D pose and camera geometry which are subsequently used to train a 3D pose estimator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard benchmark datasets (i.e. Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) where we set the new state-of-the-art among weakly/self-supervised methods. Furthermore, we propose a new performance measure Pose Structure Score (PSS) which is a scale invariant, structure aware measure to evaluate the structural plausibility of a pose with respect to its ground truth.

109,FSA-Net: Learning Fine-Grained Structure Aggregation for Head Pose Estimation From a Single Image,"This paper proposes a method for head pose estimation from a single image. Previous methods often predict head poses through landmark or depth estimation and would require more computation than necessary. Our method is based on regression and feature aggregation. For having a compact model, we employ the soft stagewise regression scheme. Existing feature aggregation methods treat inputs as a bag of features and thus ignore their spatial relationship in a feature map. We propose to learn a fine-grained structure mapping for spatially grouping features before aggregation. The fine-grained structure provides part-based information and pooled values. By utilizing learnable and non-learnable importance over the spatial location, different model variants can be generated and form a complementary ensemble. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods including both the landmark-free ones and the ones based on landmark or depth estimation. With only a single RGB frame as input, our method even outperforms methods utilizing multi-modality information (RGB-D, RGB-Time) on estimating the yaw angle. Furthermore, the memory overhead of our model is 100 times smaller than those of previous methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"FSA-Net:,Learning,Fine-Grained,Structure,Aggregation,for,Head,Pose,Estimation,From,a,Single,Image"
110,Dense 3D Face Decoding Over 2500FPS: Joint Texture & Shape Convolutional Mesh Decoders,"3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) are statistical models that represent facial texture and shape variations using a set of linear bases and more particular Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 3DMMs were used as statistical priors for reconstructing 3D faces from images by solving non-linear least square optimization problems. Recently, 3DMMs were used as generative models for training non-linear mappings (i.e., regressors) from image to the parameters of the models via Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). Nevertheless, all of the above methods use either fully connected layers or 2D convolutions on parametric unwrapped UV spaces leading to large networks with many parameters. In this paper, we present the first, to the best of our knowledge, non-linear 3DMMs by learning joint texture and shape auto-encoders using direct mesh convolutions. We demonstrate how these auto-encoders can be used to train very light-weight models that perform Coloured Mesh Decoding (CMD) in-the-wild at a speed of over 2500 FPS.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dense,3D,Face,Decoding,Over,2500FPS:,Joint,Texture,&,Shape,Convolutional,Mesh,Decoders"
111,Does Learning Specific Features for Related Parts Help Human Pose Estimation?,"Human pose estimation (HPE) is inherently a homogeneous multi-task learning problem, with the localization of each body part as a different task. Recent HPE approaches universally learn a shared representation for all parts, from which their locations are linearly regressed. However, our statistical analysis indicates not all parts are related to each other. As a result, such a sharing mechanism can lead to negative transfer and deteriorate the performance. This potential issue drives us to raise an interesting question.  Can we identify related parts and learn specific features for them to improve pose estimation? Since unrelated tasks no longer share a high-level representation, we expect to avoid the adverse effect of negative transfer.  In addition, more explicit structural knowledge, e.g., ankles and knees are highly related, is incorporated into the model, which helps resolve ambiguities in HPE. To answer this question, we first propose a data-driven approach to group related parts based on how much information they share. Then a part-based branching network (PBN) is introduced to learn representations specific to each part group. We further present a multi-stage version of this network to repeatedly refine intermediate features and pose estimates. Ablation experiments indicate learning specific features significantly improves the localization of occluded parts and thus benefits HPE. Our approach also outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, with an outstanding advantage when occlusion occurs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Does,Learning,Specific,Features,for,Related,Parts,Help,Human,Pose,Estimation?"
112,Linkage Based Face Clustering via Graph Convolution Network,"In this paper, we present an accurate and scalable approach to the face clustering task. We aim at grouping a set of faces by their potential identities. We formulate this task as a link prediction problem: a link exists between two faces if they are of the same identity. The key idea is that we find the local context in the feature space around an instance (face) contains rich information about the linkage relationship between this instance and its neighbors. By constructing sub-graphs around each instance as input data, which depict the local context, we utilize the graph convolution network (GCN) to perform reasoning and infer the likelihood of linkage between pairs in the sub-graphs. Experiments show that our method is more robust to the complex distribution of faces than conventional methods, yielding favorably comparable results to state-of-the-art methods on standard face clustering benchmarks, and is scalable to large datasets. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method does not need the number of clusters as prior, is aware of noises and outliers, and can be extended to a multi-view version for more accurate clustering accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Linkage,Based,Face,Clustering,via,Graph,Convolution,Network"
113,Towards High-Fidelity Nonlinear 3D Face Morphable Model,"Embedding 3D morphable basis functions into deep neural networks opens great potential for models with better representation power. However, to faithfully learn those models from an image collection, it requires strong regularization to overcome ambiguities involved in the learning process. This critically prevents us from learning high fidelity face models which are needed to represent face images in high level of details. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel approach to learn additional proxies as means to side-step strong regularizations, as well as, leverages to promote detailed shape/albedo. To ease the learning, we also propose to use a dual-pathway network, a carefully-designed architecture that brings a balance between global and local-based models. By improving the nonlinear 3D morphable model in both learning objective and network architecture, we present a model which is superior in capturing higher level of details than the linear or its precedent nonlinear counterparts. As a result, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D face reconstruction by solely optimizing latent representations.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,High-Fidelity,Nonlinear,3D,Face,Morphable,Model"
114,RegularFace: Deep Face Recognition via Exclusive Regularization,"We consider the face recognition task where facial images of the same identity (person) is expected to be closer in the representation space, while different identities be far apart. Several recent studies encourage the intra-class compactness by developing loss functions that penalize the variance of representations of the same identity. In this paper, we propose the `exclusive regularization'  that focuses on the other aspect of discriminability --  the inter-class separability,  which is neglected in many recent approaches. The proposed method, named RegularFace, explicitly distances identities by penalizing the angle between an identity and its nearest neighbor, resulting in discriminative face representations. Our method has intuitive geometric interpretation and presents unique benefits that are absent in previous works. Quantitative comparisons against prior methods on several open benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. In addition, our method is easy to implement and requires only a few lines of python code on modern deep learning frameworks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"RegularFace:,Deep,Face,Recognition,via,Exclusive,Regularization"
115,BridgeNet: A Continuity-Aware Probabilistic Network for Age Estimation,"Age estimation is an important yet very challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods for age estimation usually apply a divide-and-conquer strategy to deal with heterogeneous data caused by the non-stationary aging process. However, the facial aging process is also a continuous process, and the continuity relationship between different components has not been effectively exploited. In this paper, we propose BridgeNet for age estimation, which aims to mine the continuous relation between age labels effectively. The proposed BridgeNet consists of local regressors and gating networks. Local regressors partition the data space into multiple overlapping subspaces to tackle heterogeneous data and gating networks learn continuity aware weights for the results of local regressors by employing the proposed bridge-tree structure, which introduces bridge connections into tree models to enforce the similarity between neighbor nodes. Moreover, these two components of BridgeNet can be jointly learned in an end-to-end way. We show experimental results on the MORPH II, FG-NET and Chalearn LAP 2015 datasets and find that BridgeNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"BridgeNet:,A,Continuity-Aware,Probabilistic,Network,for,Age,Estimation"
116,GANFIT: Generative Adversarial Network Fitting for High Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction,"In the past few years, a lot of work has been done towards reconstructing the 3D facial structure from single images by capitalizing on the power of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). In the most recent works, differentiable renderers were employed in order to learn the relationship between the facial identity features and the parameters of a 3D morphable model for shape and texture. The texture features either correspond to components of a linear texture space or are learned by auto-encoders directly from in-the-wild images. In all cases, the quality of the facial texture reconstruction of the state-of-the-art methods is still not capable of modeling textures in high fidelity. In this paper, we take a radically different approach and harness the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and DCNNs in order to reconstruct the facial texture and shape from single images. That is, we utilize GANs to train a very powerful generator of facial texture in UV space. Then, we revisit the original 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) fitting approaches making use of non-linear optimization to find the optimal latent parameters that best reconstruct the test image but under a new perspective. We optimize the parameters with the supervision of pretrained deep identity features through our end-to-end differentiable framework. We demonstrate excellent results in photorealistic and identity preserving 3D face reconstructions and achieve for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, facial texture reconstruction with high-frequency details.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"GANFIT:,Generative,Adversarial,Network,Fitting,for,High,Fidelity,3D,Face,Reconstruction"
117,Improving the Performance of Unimodal Dynamic Hand-Gesture Recognition With Multimodal Training,"We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition.   Instead of explicitly combining multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods, we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an improved performance.  In particular, we dedicate separate networks per available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop networks with common semantics and better representations.  We introduce a ""spatiotemporal semantic alignment"" loss (SSA) to align the content of the features from different networks.  In addition, we regularize this loss with our proposed ""focal regularization parameter"" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.   Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Improving,the,Performance,of,Unimodal,Dynamic,Hand-Gesture,Recognition,With,Multimodal,Training"

From semantic segmentation images, our Octopus model reconstructs a 3D shape, including the parameters of SMPL plus clothing and hair in 10 seconds or less.  The model achieves fast and accurate predictions based on two key design choices. First, by predicting shape in a canonical T-pose space, the network learns to encode the images of the person into pose-invariant latent codes, where the information is fused. Second, based on the observation that feed-forward predictions are fast but do not always align with the input images, we predict using both, bottom-up and top-down streams (one per view) allowing information to flow in both directions. Learning relies only on synthetic 3D data. Once learned, Octopus can take a variable number of frames as input, and is able to reconstruct shapes even from a single image with an accuracy of 5mm. Results on 3 different datasets demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of our approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Reconstruct,People,in,Clothing,From,a,Single,RGB,Camera"
119,Distilled Person Re-Identification: Towards a More Scalable System,"Person re-identification (Re-ID), for matching pedestrians across non-overlapping camera views, has made great progress in supervised learning with abundant labelled data. However, the scalability problem is the bottleneck for applications in large-scale systems. We consider the scalability problem of Re-ID from three aspects: (1) low labelling cost by reducing label amount, (2) low extension cost by reusing existing knowledge and (3) low testing computation cost by using lightweight models. The requirements render scalable Re-ID a challenging problem. To solve these problems in a unified system, we propose a Multi-teacher Adaptive Similarity Distillation Framework, which requires only a few labelled identities of target domain to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a user-specified lightweight student model without accessing source domain data. We propose the Log-Euclidean Similarity Distillation Loss for Re-ID and further integrate the Adaptive Knowledge Aggregator to select effective teacher models to transfer target-adaptive knowledge. Extensive evaluations show that our method can extend with high scalability and the performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised Re-ID methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Distilled,Person,Re-Identification:,Towards,a,More,Scalable,System"

In this paper, we tackle the problem of self-supervised temporal segmentation that alleviates the need for any supervision in the form of labels (full supervision) or temporal ordering (weak supervision). We introduce a self-supervised, predictive learning framework that draws inspiration from cognitive psychology to segment long, visually complex videos into constituent events. Learning involves only a single pass through the training data. We also introduce a new adaptive learning paradigm that helps reduce the effect of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets - Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and INRIA Instructional Videos datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach.  We show that the proposed approach outperforms weakly-supervised and unsupervised baselines by up to 24% and achieves competitive segmentation results compared to fully supervised baselines with only a single pass through the training data. Finally, we show that the proposed self-supervised learning paradigm learns highly discriminating features to improve action recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"A,Perceptual,Prediction,Framework,for,Self,Supervised,Event,Segmentation"

However, most existing datasets for instruction video analysis have the limitations in diversity and scale, which makes them far from many real-world applications where more diverse activities occur. Moreover, it still remains a great challenge to organize and harness such data. To address these problems, we introduce a large-scale dataset called ""COIN"" for COmprehensive INstruction video analysis. Organized with a hierarchical structure, the COIN dataset contains 11,827 videos of 180 tasks in 12 domains (e.g., vehicles, gadgets, etc.) related to our daily life. With a new developed toolbox, all the videos are annotated effectively with a series of step descriptions and the corresponding temporal boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to capture the dependencies among different steps, which can be easily plugged into conventional proposal-based action detection methods for localizing important steps in instruction videos. In order to provide a benchmark for instruction video analysis, we evaluate plenty of approaches on the COIN dataset under different evaluation criteria. We expect the introduction of the COIN dataset will promote the future in-depth research on instruction video analysis for the community.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"COIN:,A,Large-Scale,Dataset,for,Comprehensive,Instructional,Video,Analysis"
122,Recurrent Attentive Zooming for Joint Crowd Counting and Precise Localization,"Crowd counting is a new frontier in computer vision with far-reaching applications particularly in social safety management. A majority of existing works adopt a methodology that first estimates a person-density map and then calculates integral over this map to obtain the final count. As noticed by several prior investigations, the learned density map can significantly deviate from the true person density even though the final reported count is precise. This implies that the density map is unreliable for localizing crowd. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel framework that simultaneously solving two inherently related tasks - crowd counting and localization. The contributions are several-fold. First, our formulation is based on a crucial observation that localization tends to be inaccurate at high-density regions, and increasing the resolution is an effective albeit simple solution for improving localization. We thus propose Recurrent Attentive Zooming Network, which recurrently detects ambiguous image region and zooms it into high resolution for re-inspection. Second, the two tasks of counting and localization mutually reinforce each other. We propose an adaptive fusion scheme that effectively elevates the performance. Finally, a well-defined evaluation metric is proposed for the rarely-explored localization task. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several crowd benchmarks, including the newly-developed large-scale UCF-QNRF dataset and demonstrate superior advantages over state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Recurrent,Attentive,Zooming,for,Joint,Crowd,Counting,and,Precise,Localization"

Recent studies have shown that exploring spatial and temporal features of the skeleton sequence is vital for this task. Nevertheless, how to effectively extract discriminative spatial and temporal features is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention Enhanced Graph Convolutional LSTM Network (AGC-LSTM) for human action recognition from skeleton data. The proposed AGC-LSTM can not only capture discriminative features in spatial configuration and temporal dynamics but also explore the co-occurrence relationship between spatial and temporal domains. We also present a temporal hierarchical architecture to increase temporal receptive fields of the top AGC-LSTM layer, which boosts the ability to learn the high-level semantic representation and significantly reduces the computation cost. Furthermore, to select discriminative spatial information, the attention mechanism is employed to enhance information of key joints in each AGC-LSTM layer. Experimental results on two datasets are provided: NTU RGB+D dataset and Northwestern-UCLA dataset. The comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"An,Attention,Enhanced,Graph,Convolutional,LSTM,Network,for,Skeleton-Based,Action,Recognition"
124,Graph Convolutional Label Noise Cleaner: Train a Plug-And-Play Action Classifier for Anomaly Detection,"Video anomaly detection under weak labels is formulated as a typical multiple-instance learning problem in previous works. In this paper, we provide a new perspective, i.e., a supervised learning task under noisy labels. In such a viewpoint, as long as cleaning away label noise, we can directly apply fully supervised action classifiers to weakly supervised anomaly detection, and take maximum advantage of these well-developed classifiers. For this purpose, we devise a graph convolutional network to correct noisy labels. Based upon feature similarity and temporal consistency, our network propagates supervisory signals from high-confidence snippets to low-confidence ones. In this manner, the network is capable of providing cleaned supervision for action classifiers. During the test phase, we only need to obtain snippet-wise predictions from the action classifier without any extra post-processing. Extensive experiments on 3 datasets at different scales with 2 types of action classifiers demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Remarkably, we obtain the frame-level AUC score of 82.12% on UCF-Crime.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Graph,Convolutional,Label,Noise,Cleaner:,Train,a,Plug-And-Play,Action,Classifier,for,Anomaly,Detection"
125,MAN: Moment Alignment Network for Natural Language Moment Retrieval via Iterative Graph Adjustment,"This research strives for natural language moment retrieval in long, untrimmed video streams. The problem  is not trivial especially when a video contains multiple moments of interests and the language describes complex temporal dependencies, which often happens in real scenarios. We identify two crucial challenges: semantic misalignment and structural misalignment. However, existing approaches treat different moments separately and do not explicitly model complex moment-wise temporal relations. In this paper, we present Moment Alignment Network (MAN), a novel framework that unifies the candidate moment encoding and temporal structural reasoning in a single-shot feed-forward network. MAN naturally assigns candidate moment representations aligned with language semantics over different temporal locations and scales. Most importantly, we propose to explicitly model moment-wise temporal relations as a structured graph and devise an iterative graph adjustment network to jointly learn the best structure in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate the proposed approach on two challenging public benchmarks DiDeMo and Charades-STA, where our MAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MAN:,Moment,Alignment,Network,for,Natural,Language,Moment,Retrieval,via,Iterative,Graph,Adjustment"

We propose a scalable unsupervised solution that exploits video duration as an implicit supervision signal. Our key insight is that video segments from shorter user-generated videos are more likely to be highlights than those from longer videos, since users tend to be more selective about the content when capturing shorter videos. Leveraging this insight,  we introduce a novel ranking framework that prefers segments from shorter videos, while properly accounting for the inherent noise in the (unlabeled) training data. We use it to train a highlight detector with 10M hashtagged Instagram videos.  In experiments on two challenging public video highlight detection benchmarks, our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art for unsupervised highlight detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Less,Is,More:,Learning,Highlight,Detection,From,Video,Duration"
127,DMC-Net: Generating Discriminative Motion Cues for Fast Compressed Video Action Recognition,"Motion has shown to be useful for video understanding, where motion is typically represented by optical flow. However, computing flow from video frames is very timeconsuming. Recent works directly leverage the motion vectors and residuals readily available in the compressed video to represent motion at no cost. While this avoids flow computation, it also hurts accuracy since the motion vector is noisy and has substantially reduced resolution, which makes it a less discriminative motion representation. To remedy these issues, we propose a lightweight generator network, which reduces noises in motion vectors and captures fine motion details, achieving a more Discriminative Motion Cue (DMC) representation. Since optical flow is a more accurate motion representation, we train the DMC generator to approximate flow using a reconstruction loss and a generative adversarial loss, jointly with the downstream action classification task. Extensive evaluations on three action recognition benchmarks (HMDB-51, UCF-101, and a subset of Kinetics) confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our full system, consisting of the generator and the classifier, is coined as DMC-Net which obtains high accuracy close to that of using flow and runs two orders of magnitude faster than using optical flow at inference time.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DMC-Net:,Generating,Discriminative,Motion,Cues,for,Fast,Compressed,Video,Action,Recognition"
128,AdaFrame: Adaptive Frame Selection for Fast Video Recognition,"We present AdaFrame, a framework that adaptively selects relevant frames on a per-input basis for fast video recognition. AdaFrame contains a Long Short-Term Memory network augmented with a global memory that provides context information for searching which frames to use over time. Trained with policy gradient methods, AdaFrame generates a prediction, determines which frame to observe next, and computes the utility, i.e., expected future rewards, of seeing more frames at each time step. At testing time, AdaFrame exploits predicted utilities to achieve adaptive lookahead inference such that the overall computational costs are reduced without incurring a decrease in accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale video benchmarks, FCVID and ActivityNet. AdaFrame matches the performance of using all frames with only 8.21 and 8.65 frames on FCVID and ActivityNet, respectively. We further qualitatively demonstrate learned frame usage can indicate the difficulty of making classification decisions; easier samples need fewer frames while harder ones require more, both at instance-level within the same class and at class-level among different categories.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"AdaFrame:,Adaptive,Frame,Selection,for,Fast,Video,Recognition"

Existing keyword-based or content-based video retrieval methods usually determine what occurs in a video but not when and where. In this paper, we make an answer to the question of when and where by formulating a new task, namely spatio-temporal video re-localization. Specifically, given a query video and a reference video, spatio-temporal video re-localization aims to localize tubelets in the reference video such that the tubelets semantically correspond to the query. To accurately localize the desired tubelets in the reference video, we propose a novel warp LSTM network, which propagates the spatio-temporal information for a long period and thereby captures the corresponding long-term dependencies. Another issue for spatio-temporal video re-localization is the lack of properly labeled video datasets. Therefore, we reorganize the videos in the AVA dataset to form a new dataset for spatio-temporal video re-localization research. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed model achieves superior performances over the designed baselines on the spatio-temporal video re-localization task.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spatio-Temporal,Video,Re-Localization,by,Warp,LSTM"

In this work, we first identify two underexplored problems posed by the weak supervision for temporal action localization, namely action completeness modeling and action-context separation. Then by presenting a novel network architecture and its training strategy, the two problems are explicitly looked into. Specifically, to model the completeness of actions, we propose a multi-branch neural network in which branches are enforced to discover distinctive action parts. Complete actions can be therefore localized by fusing activations from different branches. And to separate action instances from their surrounding context, we generate hard negative data for training using the prior that motionless video clips are unlikely to be actions. Experiments performed on datasets THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In particular, the average mAP on ActivityNet v1.2 is significantly improved from 18.0% to 22.4%.

Different from existing approaches using extensive annotated data for supervised learning, our CNN model is trained on large-scale unlabeled videos in an unsupervised manner. Our motivation is that a robust tracker should be effective in both the forward and backward predictions (i.e., the tracker can forward localize the target object in successive frames and backtrace to its initial position in the first frame). We build our framework on a Siamese correlation filter network, which is trained using unlabeled raw videos. Meanwhile, we propose a multiple-frame validation method and a cost-sensitive loss to facilitate unsupervised learning. Without bells and whistles, the proposed unsupervised tracker achieves the baseline accuracy of fully supervised trackers, which require complete and accurate labels during training.

132,Tracking by Animation: Unsupervised Learning of Multi-Object Attentive Trackers,"Online Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) from videos is a challenging computer vision task which has been extensively studied for decades. Most of the existing MOT algorithms are based on the Tracking-by-Detection (TBD) paradigm combined with popular machine learning approaches which largely reduce the human effort to tune algorithm parameters. However, the commonly used supervised learning approaches require the labeled data (e.g., bounding boxes), which is expensive for videos. Also, the TBD framework is usually suboptimal since it is not end-to-end, i.e., it considers the task as detection and tracking, but not jointly. To achieve both label-free and end-to-end learning of MOT, we propose a Tracking-by-Animation framework, where a differentiable neural model first tracks objects from input frames and then animates these objects into reconstructed frames. Learning is then driven by the reconstruction error through backpropagation. We further propose a Reprioritized Attentive Tracking to improve the robustness of data association.

We present SoPhie; an interpretable framework based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which leverages two sources of information, the path history of all the agents in a scene, and the scene context information, using images of the scene. To predict a future path for an agent, both physical and social information must be leveraged. Previous work has not been successful to jointly model physical and social interactions. Our approach blends a social attention mechanism with physical attention that helps the model to learn where to look in a large scene and extract the most salient parts of the image relevant to the path. Whereas, the social attention component aggregates information across the different agent interactions and extracts the most important trajectory information from the surrounding neighbors. SoPhie also takes advantage of GAN to generates more realistic samples and to capture the uncertain nature of the future paths by modeling its distribution. All these mechanisms enable our approach to predict socially and physically plausible paths for the agents and to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several different trajectory forecasting benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SoPhie:,An,Attentive,GAN,for,Predicting,Paths,Compliant,to,Social,and,Physical,Constraints"
136,Leveraging Shape Completion for 3D Siamese Tracking,"Point clouds are challenging to process due to their sparsity, therefore autonomous vehicles rely more on appearance attributes than pure geometric features. However, 3D LIDAR perception can provide crucial information for urban navigation in challenging light or weather conditions. In this paper, we investigate the versatility of Shape Completion for 3D Object Tracking in LIDAR point clouds. We design a Siamese tracker that encodes model and candidate shapes into a compact latent representation. We regularize the encoding by enforcing the latent representation to decode into an object model shape. We observe that 3D object tracking and 3D shape completion complement each other. Learning a more meaningful latent representation shows better discriminatory capabilities, leading to improved tracking performance. We test our method on the KITTI Tracking set using car 3D bounding boxes. Our model reaches a 76.94% Success rate and 81.38% Precision for 3D Object Tracking, with the shape completion regularization leading to an improvement of 3% in both metrics.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Leveraging,Shape,Completion,for,3D,Siamese,Tracking"
137,Target-Aware Deep Tracking,"Existing deep trackers mainly use convolutional neural networks pre-trained for the generic object recognition task for representations. Despite demonstrated successes for numerous vision tasks, the contributions of using pre-trained deep features for visual tracking are not as significant as that for object recognition. The key issue is that in visual tracking the targets of interest can be arbitrary object class with arbitrary forms. As such, pre-trained deep features are less effective in modeling these targets of arbitrary forms for distinguishing them from the background. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to learn target-aware features, which can better recognize the targets undergoing significant appearance variations than pre-trained deep features. To this end, we develop a regression loss and a ranking loss to guide the generation of target-active and scale-sensitive features. We identify the importance of each convolutional filter according to the back-propagated gradients and select the target-aware features based on activations for representing the targets. The target-aware features are integrated with a Siamese matching network for visual tracking. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Target-Aware,Deep,Tracking"
138,Spatiotemporal CNN for Video Object Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a unified, end-to-end trainable spatiotemporal CNN model for VOS, which consists of two branches, i.e., the temporal coherence branch and the spatial segmentation branch. Specifically, the temporal coherence branch pretrained in an adversarial fashion from unlabeled video data, is designed to capture the dynamic appearance and motion cues of video sequences to guide object segmentation. The spatial segmentation branch focuses on segmenting objects accurately based on the learned appearance and motion cues. To obtain accurate segmentation results, we design a coarse-to-fine process to sequentially apply a designed attention module on multi-scale feature maps, and concatenate them to produce the final prediction. In this way, the spatial segmentation branch is enforced to gradually concentrate on object regions. These two branches are jointly fine-tuned on video segmentation sequences in an end-to-end manner. Several experiments are carried out on three challenging datasets (i.e., DAVIS-2016, DAVIS-2017 and Youtube-Object) to show that our method achieves favorable performance against the state-of-the-arts.

139,Towards Rich Feature Discovery With Class Activation Maps Augmentation for Person Re-Identification,"The fundamental challenge of small inter-person variation requires Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) models to capture sufficient fine-grained information. This paper proposes to discover diverse discriminative visual cues without extra assistance, e.g., pose estimation, human parsing. Specifically, a Class Activation Maps (CAM) augmentation model is proposed to expand the activation scope of baseline Re-ID model to explore rich visual cues, where the backbone network is extended by a series of ordered branches which share the same input but output complementary CAM. A novel Overlapped Activation Penalty is proposed to force the new branch to pay more attention to the image regions less activated by the old ones, such that spatial diverse visual features can be discovered. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on three person Re-ID benchmarks. Moreover, a visualization approach termed ranking activation map (RAM) is proposed to explicitly interpret the ranking results in the test stage, which gives qualitative validations of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Rich,Feature,Discovery,With,Class,Activation,Maps,Augmentation,for,Person,Re-Identification"

This seemingly easy task actually faces many crucial technical challenges and has its unique properties. The two major issues are size expansion and one-side constraints. We propose a semantic regeneration network with several special contributions and use multiple spatial related losses to address these issues. Our results contain consistent structures and high-quality textures. Extensive experiments are conducted on various possible alternatives and related methods.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end solution to synthesize a time-lapse video from a single outdoor image using deep neural networks. Our key idea is to train a conditional generative adversarial network based on existing datasets of time-lapse videos and image sequences. We propose a multi-frame joint conditional generation framework to effectively learn the correlation between the illumination change of an outdoor scene and the time of the day. We further present a multi-domain training scheme for robust training of our generative models from two datasets with different distributions and missing timestamp labels. Compared to alternative time-lapse video synthesis algorithms, our method uses the timestamp as the control variable and does not require a reference video to guide the synthesis of the final output. We conduct ablation studies to validate our algorithm and compare with state-of-the-art techniques both qualitatively and quantitatively.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"End-To-End,Time-Lapse,Video,Synthesis,From,a,Single,Outdoor,Image"

Despite their small sizes, GIF images often contain undesirable visual artifacts such as flat color regions, false contours, color shift, and dotted patterns. In this paper, we propose GIF2Video, the first learning-based method for enhancing the visual quality of GIFs in the wild. We focus on the challenging task of GIF restoration by recovering information lost in the three steps of GIF creation: frame sampling, color quantization, and color dithering. We first propose a novel CNN architecture for color dequantization. It is built upon a compositional architecture for multi-step color correction, with a comprehensive loss function designed to handle large quantization errors. We then adapt the SuperSlomo network for temporal interpolation of GIF frames. We introduce two large datasets, namely GIF-Faces and GIF-Moments, for both training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the visual quality of GIFs, and outperforms direct baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"GIF2Video:,Color,Dequantization,and,Temporal,Interpolation,of,GIF,Images"
143,Mode Seeking Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Image Synthesis,"Most conditional generation tasks expect diverse outputs given a single conditional context. However, conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) often focus on the prior conditional information and ignore the input noise vectors, which contribute to the output variations. Recent attempts to resolve the mode collapse issue for cGANs are usually task-specific and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective regularization term to address the mode collapse issue for cGANs. The proposed method explicitly maximizes the ratio of the distance between generated images with respect to the corresponding latent codes, thus encouraging the generators to explore more minor modes during training. This mode seeking regularization term is readily applicable to various conditional generation tasks without imposing training overhead or modifying the original network structures. We validate the proposed algorithm on three conditional image synthesis tasks including categorical generation, image-to-image translation, and text-to-image synthesis with different baseline models. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization method for improving diversity without loss of quality.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mode,Seeking,Generative,Adversarial,Networks,for,Diverse,Image,Synthesis"
144,Pluralistic Image Completion,"Most image completion methods produce only one result for each masked input, although there may be many reasonable possibilities. In this paper, we present an approach for pluralistic image completion - the task of generating multiple and diverse plausible solutions for image completion. A major challenge faced by learning-based approaches is that usually only one ground truth training instance per label. As such, sampling from conditional VAEs still leads to minimal diversity. To overcome this, we propose a novel and probabilistically principled framework with two parallel paths. One is a reconstructive path that utilizes the only one given ground truth to get prior distribution of missing parts and rebuild the original image from this distribution. The other is a generative path for which the conditional prior is coupled to the distribution obtained in the reconstructive path. Both are supported by GANs. We also introduce a new short+long term attention layer that exploits distant relations among decoder and encoder features, improving appearance consistency. When tested on datasets with buildings (Paris), faces (CelebA-HQ), and natural images (ImageNet), our method not only generated higherquality completion results, but also with multiple and diverse plausible outputs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pluralistic,Image,Completion"
145,Salient Object Detection With Pyramid Attention and Salient Edges,"This paper presents a new method for detecting salient objects in images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed network, named PAGE-Net, offers two key contributions. The first is the exploitation of an essential pyramid attention structure for salient object detection. This enables the network to concentrate more on salient regions while considering multi-scale saliency information. Such a stacked attention design provides a powerful tool to efficiently improve the representation ability of the corresponding network layer with an enlarged receptive field. The second contribution lies in the emphasis on the importance of salient edges. Salient edge information offers a strong cue to better segment salient objects and refine object boundaries. To this end, our model is equipped with a salient edge detection module, which is learned for precise salient boundary estimation. This encourages better edge-preserving salient object segmentation. Exhaustive experiments confirm that the proposed pyramid attention and salient edges are effective for salient object detection. We show that our deep saliency model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for several benchmarks with a fast processing speed (25fps on one GPU).",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Salient,Object,Detection,With,Pyramid,Attention,and,Salient,Edges"
146,Latent Filter Scaling for Multimodal Unsupervised Image-To-Image Translation,"In multimodal unsupervised image-to-image translation tasks, the goal is to translate an image from the source domain to many images in the target domain. We present a simple method that produces higher quality images than current state-of-the-art while maintaining the same amount of multimodal diversity. Previous methods follow the unconditional approach of trying to map the latent code directly to a full-size image. This leads to complicated network architectures with several introduced hyperparameters to tune. By treating the latent code as a modifier of the convolutional filters, we produce multimodal output while maintaining the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) loss and without additional hyperparameters. The only tuning required by our method controls the tradeoff between variability and quality of generated images. Furthermore, we achieve disentanglement between source domain content and target domain style for free as a by-product of our formulation. We perform qualitative and quantitative experiments showing the advantages of our method compared with the state-of-the art on multiple benchmark image-to-image translation datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Latent,Filter,Scaling,for,Multimodal,Unsupervised,Image-To-Image,Translation"
147,Attention-Aware Multi-Stroke Style Transfer,"Neural style transfer has drawn considerable attention from both academic and industrial field. Although visual effect and efficiency have been significantly improved, existing methods are unable to coordinate spatial distribution of visual attention between the content image and stylized image, or render diverse level of detail via different brush strokes. In this paper, we tackle these limitations by developing an attention-aware multi-stroke style transfer model. We first propose to assemble self-attention mechanism into a style-agnostic reconstruction autoencoder framework, from which the attention map of a content image can be derived. By performing multi-scale style swap on content features and style features, we produce multiple feature maps reflecting different stroke patterns. A flexible fusion strategy is further presented to incorporate the salient characteristics from the attention map, which allows integrating multiple stroke patterns into different spatial regions of the output image harmoniously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, as well as generate comparable stylized images with multiple stroke patterns against the state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attention-Aware,Multi-Stroke,Style,Transfer"

We formulate the generation task as a recurrent framework, in which the discriminator's feedback is integrated into the feedforward path of the generation process. Specifically, the generator conditions on the discriminator's spatial output response, and its previous generation to improve generation quality over time - allowing the generator to attend and fix its previous mistakes. To effectively utilize the feedback, we propose an adaptive spatial transform layer, which learns to spatially modulate feature maps from its previous generation and the error signal from the discriminator. We demonstrate that one can easily adapt FAL to existing adversarial learning frameworks on a wide range of tasks, including image generation, image-to-image translation, and voxel generation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Feedback,Adversarial,Learning:,Spatial,Feedback,for,Improving,Generative,Adversarial,Networks"
149,Learning Pyramid-Context Encoder Network for High-Quality Image Inpainting,"High-quality image inpainting requires filling missing regions in a damaged image with plausible content. Existing works either fill the regions by copying high-resolution patches or generating semantically-coherent patches from region context, while neglecting the fact that both visual and semantic plausibility are highly-demanded. In this paper, we propose a Pyramid-context Encoder Network (denoted as PEN-Net) for image inpainting by deep generative models. The proposed PEN-Net is built upon a U-Net structure with three tailored components, ie., a pyramid-context encoder, a multi-scale decoder, and an adversarial training loss. First, we adopt a U-Net as backbone which can encode the context of an image from high-resolution pixels into high-level semantic features, and decode the features reversely. Second, we propose a pyramid-context encoder, which progressively learns region affinity by attention from a high-level semantic feature map, and transfers the learned attention to its adjacent high-resolution feature map. As the missing content can be filled by attention transfer from deep to shallow in a pyramid fashion, both visual and semantic coherence for image inpainting can be ensured. Third, we further propose a multi-scale decoder with deeply-supervised pyramid losses and an adversarial loss. Such a design not only results in fast convergence in training, but more realistic results in testing. Extensive experiments on a broad range of datasets shows the superior performance of the proposed network.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Pyramid-Context,Encoder,Network,for,High-Quality,Image,Inpainting"

We use the term ""style"" in this problem to refer to implicit characteristics of images, for example: in portraits  ""style""  includes gender, racial identity, age, hairstyle; in full body pictures it includes clothing; in street scenes it refers to weather and time of day and such like. A semantic label map in these cases indicates facial expression, full body pose, or scene segmentation. We propose a solution to the example-guided image synthesis problem using conditional generative adversarial networks with style consistency. Our key contributions are (i) a novel style consistency discriminator to determine whether a pair of images are consistent in style; (ii) an adaptive semantic consistency loss; and (iii) a training data sampling strategy, for synthesizing style-consistent results to the exemplar.

151,MirrorGAN: Learning Text-To-Image Generation by Redescription,"Generating an image from a given text description has two goals: visual realism and semantic consistency. Although significant progress has been made in generating high-quality and visually realistic images using generative adversarial networks, guaranteeing semantic consistency between the text description and visual content remains very challenging. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel global-local attentive and semantic-preserving text-to-image-to-text framework called MirrorGAN. MirrorGAN exploits the idea of learning text-to-image generation by redescription and consists of three modules: a semantic text embedding module (STEM), a global-local collaborative attentive module for cascaded image generation (GLAM), and a semantic text regeneration and alignment module (STREAM). STEM generates word- and sentence-level embeddings. GLAM has a cascaded architecture for generating target images from coarse to fine scales, leveraging both local word attention and global sentence attention to progressively enhance the diversity and semantic consistency of the generated images. STREAM seeks to regenerate the text description from the generated image, which semantically aligns with the given text description. Thorough experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MirrorGAN over other representative state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MirrorGAN:,Learning,Text-To-Image,Generation,by,Redescription"
152,Light Field Messaging With Deep Photographic Steganography,"We develop Light Field Messaging (LFM), a process of  embedding, transmitting, and receiving  hidden information in video that is displayed on a screen and captured by a handheld camera. The goal of the system is to minimize  perceived visual artifacts of the message embedding, while simultaneously maximizing the accuracy of message recovery on the camera side. LFM requires photographic steganography for embedding messages that can be displayed and camera-captured. Unlike digital steganography, the embedding requirements are significantly more challenging due to the combined effect of the screen's radiometric emittance function, the camera's sensitivity function, and  the camera-display relative geometry. We devise and train a  network to jointly learn a deep embedding and recovery algorithm that requires no multi-frame synchronization. A key novel component is the  camera display transfer function (CDTF) to model the camera-display pipeline. To learn this CDTF we introduce a dataset (Camera-Display 1M) of 1,000,000 camera-captured images collected from 25 camera-display pairs.

This is a challenging task due to multiple stroke types (e.g., outline and shading), structural complexity of pencil shading (e.g., hatching), and the lack of aligned training data pairs. To address these challenges, we develop a two-branch model that learns separate filters for generating sketchy outlines and tonal shading from a collection of pencil drawings. We create training data pairs by extracting clean outlines and tonal illustrations from original pencil drawings using image filtering techniques, and we manually label the drawing styles. In addition, our model creates different pencil styles (e.g., line sketchiness and shading style) in a user-controllable manner. Experimental results on different types of pencil drawings show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against existing methods in terms of quality, diversity and user evaluations.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Im2Pencil:,Controllable,Pencil,Illustration,From,Photographs"
154,When Color Constancy Goes Wrong: Correcting Improperly White-Balanced Images,"This paper focuses on correcting a camera image that has been improperly white-balanced. This situation occurs when a camera's auto white balance fails or when the wrong manual white-balance setting is used. Even after decades of computational color constancy research, there are no effective solutions to this problem. The challenge lies not in identifying what the correct white balance should have been, but in the fact that the in-camera white-balance procedure is followed by several camera-specific nonlinear color manipulations that make it challenging to correct the image's colors in post-processing. This paper introduces the first method to explicitly address this problem. Our method is enabled by a dataset of over 65,000 pairs of incorrectly white-balanced images and their corresponding correctly white-balanced images. Using this dataset, we introduce a k-nearest neighbor strategy that is able to compute a nonlinear color mapping function to correct the image's colors. We show our method is highly effective and generalizes well to camera models not in the training set.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"When,Color,Constancy,Goes,Wrong:,Correcting,Improperly,White-Balanced,Images"

We introduce an analysis-by-synthesis framework that can reconstruct complex shape and reflectance of an NLOS object. Our framework deviates from prior work on NLOS reconstruction, by directly optimizing for a surface representation of the NLOS object, in place of commonly employed volumetric representations. At the core of our framework is a new rendering formulation that efficiently computes derivatives of radiometric measurements with respect to NLOS geometry and reflectance, while accurately modeling the underlying light transport physics. By coupling this with stochastic optimization and geometry processing techniques, we are able to reconstruct NLOS surface at a level of detail significantly exceeding what is possible with previous volumetric reconstruction methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Beyond,Volumetric,Albedo,--,A,Surface,Optimization,Framework,for,Non-Line-Of-Sight,Imaging"

In this paper, we show that most cameras have an overlooked mechanism that can greatly simplify this task.  Specifically, modern DLSR and smartphone cameras use dual pixel (DP) sensors that have two photodiodes per pixel to provide two sub-aperture views of the scene from a single captured image. ""Defocus-disparity"" cues, which are natural by-products of the DP sensor encoded within these two sub-aperture views, can be used to distinguish between image gradients belonging to the in-focus background and those caused by reflection interference. This gradient information can then be incorporated into an optimization framework to recover the background layer with higher accuracy than currently possible from the single captured image. As part of this work, we provide the first image dataset for reflection removal consisting of the sub-aperture views from the DP sensor.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Reflection,Removal,Using,a,Dual-Pixel,Sensor"
157,Practical Coding Function Design for Time-Of-Flight Imaging,"The depth resolution of a continuous-wave time-of-flight (CW-ToF) imaging system is determined by its coding functions. Recently, there has been growing interest in the design of new high-performance CW-ToF coding functions. However, these functions are typically designed in a hardware agnostic manner, i.e., without considering the practical device limitations, such as bandwidth, source power, digital (binary) function generation. Therefore, despite theoretical improvements, practical implementation of these functions remains a challenge. We present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions that adhere to hardware constraints. The optimization problem is non-convex with a large search space and no known globally optimal solutions. To make the problem tractable, we design an iterative, alternating least-squares algorithm, along with convex relaxation of the constraints. Using this approach, we design high-performance coding functions that can be implemented on existing hardware with minimal modifications. We demonstrate the performance benefits of the resulting functions via extensive simulations and a hardware prototype.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Practical,Coding,Function,Design,for,Time-Of-Flight,Imaging"

In our Meta-SR,the Meta-Upscale Module is proposed to replace the tradi-tional upscale module. For arbitrary scale factor, the Meta-Upscale Module dynamically predicts the weights of the up-scale filters by taking the scale factor as input and use theseweights to generate the HR image of arbitrary size. For anylow-resolution image, our Meta-SR can continuously zoomin it with arbitrary scale factor by only using a single model.We evaluated the proposed method through extensive exper-iments on widely used benchmark datasets on single imagesuper-resolution.

However, only high-resolution multispectral (HrMS)  and low-resolution hyperspectral (LrHS) images can generally be captured at video rate in practice. In this paper, we propose a model-based deep learning approach for merging an HrMS and LrHS images to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral (HrHS) image. In specific, we construct a novel MS/HS fusion model which takes the observation models of low-resolution images and the low-rankness knowledge along the spectral mode of HrHS image into consideration. Then we design an iterative algorithm to solve the model by exploiting the proximal gradient method. And then, by unfolding the designed algorithm, we construct a deep network, called MS/HS Fusion Net, with learning the proximal operators and model parameters by convolutional neural networks.

160,Learning Attraction Field Representation for Robust Line Segment Detection,"This paper presents a region-partition based attraction field dual representation for line segment maps,  and thus poses the problem of line segment detection (LSD) as the region coloring problem.   The latter is then addressed by learning  deep  convolutional  neural  networks  (ConvNets) for accuracy, robustness and efficiency.  For a 2D line segment map,  our dual representation consists of three components:  (i) A region-partition map in which every pixel is assigned to one and only one line segment; (ii) An attraction field map in which every pixel in a partition region is encoded by its 2D projection vector w.r.t. the associated line segment; and (iii) A squeeze module which squashes the attraction  field  to  a  line  segment  map  that  almost  perfectly recovers the input one.  By leveraging the duality, we learn ConvNets to compute the attraction field maps for raw in-put images, followed by the squeeze module for LSD, in an end-to-end manner.  Our method rigorously addresses several challenges in LSD such as local ambiguity and class imbalance.  Our method also harnesses the best practices developed in ConvNets based semantic segmentation methods  such  as  the  encoder-decoder  architecture  and  the  a-trous convolution.  In experiments, our method is tested on the WireFrame dataset and the YorkUrban dataset with state-of-the-art performance obtained.  Especially, we advance the performance by 4.5 percents on the WireFramedataset.

Most of these methods assume that the blur kernel during downsampling is predefined/known (e.g., bicubic). However, the blur kernels involved in real applications are complicated and unknown, resulting in severe performance drop for the advanced SR methods. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Kernel Correction (IKC) method for blur kernel estimation in blind SR problem, where the blur kernels are unknown. We draw the observation that kernel mismatch could bring regular artifacts (either over-sharpening or over-smoothing), which can be applied to correct inaccurate blur kernels. Thus we introduce an iterative correction scheme -- IKC that achieves better results than direct kernel estimation. We further propose an effective SR network architecture using spatial feature transform (SFT) layers to handle multiple blur kernels, named SFTMD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images show that the proposed IKC method with SFTMD can provide visually favorable SR results and the state-of-the-art performance in blind SR problem.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Blind,Super-Resolution,With,Iterative,Kernel,Correction"
162,Video Magnification in the Wild Using Fractional Anisotropy in Temporal Distribution,"Video magnification methods can magnify and reveal subtle changes invisible to the naked eye. However, in such subtle changes, meaningful ones caused by physical and natural phenomena are mixed with non-meaningful ones caused by photographic noise. Therefore, current methods often produce noisy and misleading magnification outputs due to the non-meaningful subtle changes. For detecting only meaningful subtle changes, several methods have been proposed but require human manipulations, additional resources, or input video scene limitations. In this paper, we present a novel method using fractional anisotropy (FA) to detect only meaningful subtle changes without the aforementioned requirements. FA has been used in neuroscience to evaluate anisotropic diffusion of water molecules in the body. On the basis of our observation that temporal distribution of meaningful subtle changes more clearly indicates anisotropic diffusion than that of non-meaningful ones, we used FA to design a fractional anisotropic filter that passes only meaningful subtle changes.

However, most of them have suffered from the boundary challenge. The state-of-the-art methods employ feature aggregation tech- nique and can precisely find out wherein the salient object, but they often fail to segment out the entire object with fine boundaries, especially those raised narrow stripes. So there is still a large room for improvement over the FCN based models. In this paper, we design the Attentive Feedback Modules (AFMs) to better explore the structure of objects. A Boundary-Enhanced Loss (BEL) is further employed for learning exquisite boundaries. Our proposed deep model produces satisfying results on the object boundaries and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five widely tested salient object detection benchmarks. The network is in a fully convolutional fashion running at a speed of 26 FPS and does not need any post-processing.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attentive,Feedback,Network,for,Boundary-Aware,Salient,Object,Detection"
164,Heavy Rain Image Restoration: Integrating Physics Model and Conditional Adversarial Learning,"Most deraining works focus on rain streaks removal but they cannot deal adequately with heavy rain images.  In heavy rain, streaks are strongly visible, dense rain accumulation or rain veiling effect significantly washes out the image, further scenes are relatively more blurry, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address these problems. We put forth a 2-stage network: a physics-based backbone followed by a depth-guided GAN refinement. The first stage estimates the rain streaks, the transmission, and the atmospheric light governed by the underlying physics. To tease out these components more reliably, a guided filtering framework is used to decompose the image into its low- and high-frequency components. This filtering is guided by a rain-free residue image --- its content is used to set the passbands for the two channels in a spatially-variant manner so that the background details do not get mixed up with the rain-streaks. For the second stage, the refinement stage, we put forth a depth-guided GAN to recover the background details failed to be retrieved by the first stage, as well as correcting artefacts introduced by that stage. We have evaluated our method against  state of the art methods. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms them on real rain image data, recovering visually clean images with good details.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Heavy,Rain,Image,Restoration:,Integrating,Physics,Model,and,Conditional,Adversarial,Learning"
165,Learning to Calibrate Straight Lines for Fisheye Image Rectification,"This paper presents a new deep-learning based method to simultaneously calibrate the intrinsic parameters of fisheye lens and rectify the distorted images. Assuming that the distorted lines generated by fisheye projection should be straight after rectification, we propose a novel deep neural network to impose explicit geometry constraints onto processes of the fisheye lens calibration and the distorted  image  rectification. In addition, considering the nonlinearity of distortion distribution in fisheye images, the proposed network fully exploits multi-scale perception to equalize the rectification effects on the whole image. To train and evaluate the proposed model, we also create a new large-scale dataset labeled with corresponding distortion parameters and  well-annotated distorted lines. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves the best published rectification quality and the most accurate estimation of distortion parameters on a large set of synthetic and real fisheye images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Calibrate,Straight,Lines,for,Fisheye,Image,Rectification"
166,Camera Lens Super-Resolution,"Existing methods for single image super-resolution (SR) are typically evaluated with synthetic degradation models such as bicubic or Gaussian downsampling. In this paper, we investigate SR from the perspective of camera lenses, named as CameraSR, which aims to alleviate the intrinsic tradeoff between resolution (R) and field-of-view (V) in realistic imaging systems. Specifically, we view the R-V degradation as a latent model in the SR process and learn to reverse it with realistic low- and high-resolution image pairs. To obtain the paired images, we propose two novel data acquisition strategies for two representative imaging systems (i.e., DSLR and smartphone cameras), respectively. Based on the obtained City100 dataset, we quantitatively analyze the performance of commonly-used synthetic degradation models, and demonstrate the superiority of CameraSR as a practical solution to boost the performance of existing SR methods. Moreover, CameraSR can be readily generalized to different content and devices, which serves as an advanced digital zoom tool in realistic imaging systems.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Camera,Lens,Super-Resolution"
167,Frame-Consistent Recurrent Video Deraining With Dual-Level Flow,"In this paper, we address the problem of rain removal from videos by proposing a more comprehensive framework that considers the additional degradation factors in real scenes neglected in previous works. The proposed framework is built upon a two-stage recurrent network with dual-level flow regularizations to perform the inverse recovery process of the rain synthesis model for video deraining. The rain-free frame is estimated from the single rain frame at the first stage. It is then taken as guidance along with previously recovered clean frames to help obtain a more accurate clean frame at the second stage. This two-step architecture is capable of extracting more reliable motion information from the initially estimated rain-free frame at the first stage for better frame alignment and motion modeling at the second stage. Furthermore, to keep the motion consistency between frames that facilitates a frame-consistent deraining model at the second stage, a dual-level flow based regularization is proposed at both coarse flow and fine pixel levels. To better train and evaluate the proposed video deraining network, a novel rain synthesis model is developed to produce more visually authentic paired training and evaluation videos.  Extensive experiments on a series of synthetic and real videos verify not only the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art but also the effectiveness of network design and its each component.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Frame-Consistent,Recurrent,Video,Deraining,With,Dual-Level,Flow"
168,Deep Plug-And-Play Super-Resolution for Arbitrary Blur Kernels,"While deep neural networks (DNN) based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are rapidly gaining popularity, they are mainly designed for the widely-used bicubic degradation, and there still remains the fundamental challenge for them to super-resolve low-resolution (LR) image with arbitrary blur kernels. In the meanwhile, plug-and-play image restoration has been recognized with high flexibility due to its modular structure for easy plug-in of denoiser priors. In this paper, we propose a principled formulation and framework by extending bicubic degradation based deep SISR with the help of plug-and-play framework to handle LR images with arbitrary blur kernels. Specifically, we design a new SISR degradation model so as to take advantage of existing blind deblurring methods for blur kernel estimation. To optimize the new degradation induced energy function, we then derive a plug-and-play algorithm via variable splitting technique, which allows us to plug any super-resolver prior rather than the denoiser prior as a modular part. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on synthetic and real LR images demonstrate that the proposed deep plug-and-play super-resolution framework is flexible and effective to deal with blurry LR images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Plug-And-Play,Super-Resolution,for,Arbitrary,Blur,Kernels"
169,Sea-Thru: A Method for Removing Water From Underwater Images,"Robust recovery of lost colors in underwater images remains a challenging problem. We recently showed that this was partly due to the prevalent use of an atmospheric image formation model for underwater images. We proposed a physically accurate model that explicitly showed: 1) the attenuation coefficient of the signal is not uniform across the scene but depends on object range and reflectance, 2) the coefficient governing the increase in backscatter with distance differs from the signal attenuation coefficient. Here, we present a method that recovers color with the revised model using RGBD images. The Sea-thru method first calculates backscatter using the darkest pixels in the image and their known range information. Then, it uses an estimate of the spatially varying illuminant to obtain the range-dependent attenuation coefficient. Using more than 1,100 images from two optically different water bodies, which we make available, we show that our method outperforms those using the atmospheric model. Consistent removal of water will open up large underwater datasets to powerful computer vision and machine learning algorithms, creating exciting opportunities for the future of underwater exploration and conservation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Sea-Thru:,A,Method,for,Removing,Water,From,Underwater,Images"
170,Deep Network Interpolation for Continuous Imagery Effect Transition,"Deep convolutional neural network has demonstrated its capability of learning a deterministic mapping for the desired imagery effect. However, the large variety of user flavors motivates the possibility of continuous transition among different output effects. Unlike existing methods that require a specific design to achieve one particular transition (e.g., style transfer), we propose a simple yet universal approach to attain a smooth control of diverse imagery effects in many low-level vision tasks, including image restoration, image-to-image translation, and style transfer. Specifically, our method, namely Deep Network Interpolation (DNI), applies linear interpolation in the parameter space of two or more correlated networks. A smooth control of imagery effects can be achieved by tweaking the interpolation coefficients. In addition to DNI and its broad applications, we also investigate the mechanism of network interpolation from the perspective of learned filters.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Network,Interpolation,for,Continuous,Imagery,Effect,Transition"
171,Spatially Variant Linear Representation Models for Joint Filtering,"Joint filtering mainly uses an additional guidance image as a prior and transfers its structures to the target image in the filtering process. Different from existing algorithms that rely on locally linear models or hand-designed objective functions to extract the structural information from the guidance image, we propose a new joint filter based on a spatially variant linear representation model (SVLRM), where the target image is linearly represented by the guidance image. However, the SVLRM leads to a highly ill-posed problem. To estimate the linear representation coefficients, we develop an effective algorithm based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed deep CNN (constrained by the SVLRM) is able to estimate the spatially variant linear representation coefficients which are able to model the structural information of both the guidance and input images. We show that the proposed algorithm can be effectively applied to a variety of applications, including depth/RGB image upsampling and restoration, flash/no-flash image deblurring, natural image denoising, scale-aware filtering, etc. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods that have been specially designed for each task.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spatially,Variant,Linear,Representation,Models,for,Joint,Filtering"
172,Toward Convolutional Blind Denoising of Real Photographs,"While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive success in image denoising with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), their performance remains limited on real-world noisy photographs. The main reason is that their learned models are easy to overfit on the simplified AWGN model which deviates severely from the complicated real-world noise model. In order to improve the generalization ability of deep CNN denoisers, we suggest training a convolutional blind denoising network (CBDNet) with more realistic noise model and real-world noisy-clean image pairs. On the one hand, both signal-dependent noise and in-camera signal processing pipeline is considered to synthesize realistic noisy images. On the other hand, real-world noisy photographs and their nearly noise-free counterparts are also included to train our CBDNet. To further provide an interactive strategy to rectify denoising result conveniently, a noise estimation subnetwork with asymmetric learning to suppress under-estimation of noise level is embedded into CBDNet. Extensive experimental results on three datasets of real-world noisy pho- tographs clearly demonstrate the superior performance of CBDNet over state-of-the-arts in terms of quantitative met- rics and visual quality.

173,Towards Real Scene Super-Resolution With Raw Images,"Most existing super-resolution methods do not perform well in real scenarios due to lack of realistic training data and information loss of the model input. To solve the first problem, we propose a new pipeline to generate realistic training data by simulating the imaging process of digital cameras. And to remedy the information loss of the input, we develop a dual convolutional neural network to exploit the originally captured radiance information in raw images. In addition, we propose to learn a spatially-variant color transformation which helps more effective color corrections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that super-resolution with raw data helps recover fine details and clear structures, and more importantly, the proposed network and data generation pipeline achieve superior results for single image super-resolution in real scenarios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Real,Scene,Super-Resolution,With,Raw,Images"

Recent advances in convolutional neural networks are introduced into super-resolution and push forward progress in this field. Current studies have achieved impressive performance by manually designing deep residual neural networks but overly relies on practical experience. In this paper, we propose to adopt an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-inspired design scheme for single image super-resolution, which have brought us a new understanding of ResNet in classification problems. Not only is it interpretable for super-resolution but it provides a reliable guideline on network designs. By casting the numerical schemes in ODE as blueprints, we derive two types of network structures: LF-block and RK-block, which correspond to the Leapfrog method and Runge-Kutta method in numerical ordinary differential equations. We evaluate our models on benchmark datasets, and the results show that our methods surpass the state-of-the-arts while keeping comparable parameters and operations.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ODE-Inspired,Network,Design,for,Single,Image,Super-Resolution"

To solve this ill-posed problem, a great amount of image priors have been explored and employed in this area. In this paper, we present a blind deblurring method based on Local Maximum Gradient (LMG) prior. Our work is inspired by the simple and intuitive observation that the maximum value of a local patch gradient will diminish after the blur process, which is proved to be true both mathematically and empirically. This inherent property of blur process helps us to establish a new energy function. By introducing an liner operator to compute the Local Maximum Gradient, together with an effective optimization scheme, our method can handle various specific scenarios. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our method is able to achieve favorable performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world images.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Blind,Image,Deblurring,With,Local,Maximum,Gradient,Prior"
176,Attention-Guided Network for Ghost-Free High Dynamic Range Imaging,"Ghosting artifacts caused by moving objects or misalignments is a key challenge in high dynamic range (HDR) imaging for dynamic scenes. Previous methods first register the input low dynamic range (LDR) images using optical flow before merging them, which are error-prone and cause ghosts in results. A very recent work tries to bypass optical flows via a deep network with skip-connections, however, which still suffers from ghosting artifacts for severe movement. To avoid the ghosting from the source, we propose a novel attention-guided end-to-end deep neural network (AHDRNet) to produce high-quality ghost-free HDR images. Unlike previous methods directly stacking the LDR images or features for merging, we use attention modules to guide the merging according to the reference image. The attention modules automatically suppress undesired components caused by misalignments and saturation and enhance desirable fine details in the non-reference images. In addition to the attention model, we use dilated residual dense block (DRDB) to make full use of the hierarchical features and increase the receptive field for hallucinating the missing details. The proposed AHDRNet is a non-flow-based method, which can also avoid the artifacts generated by optical-flow estimation error. Experiments on different datasets show that the proposed AHDRNet can achieve state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attention-Guided,Network,for,Ghost-Free,High,Dynamic,Range,Imaging"

We propose an efficient NAS approach, which learns the searching approach by gradient descent. Our approach represents the search space as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This DAG contains thousands of sub-graphs, each of which indicates a kind of neural architecture. To avoid traversing all the possibilities of the sub-graphs, we develop a differentiable sampler over the DAG. This sampler is learnable and optimized by the validation loss after training the sampled architecture. In this way, our approach can be trained in an end-to-end fashion by gradient descent, named Gradient-based search using Differentiable Architecture Sampler (GDAS). In experiments, we can finish one searching procedure in four GPU hours on CIFAR-10, and the discovered model obtains a test error of 2.82% with only 2.5M parameters, which is on par with the state-of-the-art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Searching,for,a,Robust,Neural,Architecture,in,Four,GPU,Hours"

We present a variational denoising recursive autoencoder (VDRAE) that generates and iteratively refines a hierarchical representation of 3D object layouts, interleaving bottom-up encoding for context aggregation and top-down decoding for propagation. We train our VDRAE on large-scale 3D scene datasets to predict both instance-level segmentations and a 3D object detections from an over-segmentation of an input point cloud.

179,Adaptively Connected Neural Networks,"This paper presents a novel adaptively connected neural network (ACNet) to improve the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  in  two aspects. First, ACNet employs a flexible way to switch global and local inference in processing the internal feature representations by adaptively determining the connection status among the feature nodes (e.g., pixels of the feature maps). Note that in a computer vision domain, a node refers to a pixel of a feature map, while in the graph domain, a node denotes a graph node. We can show that existing CNNs, the classical multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the recently proposed non-local network (NLN) are all special cases of ACNet. Second, ACNet is also capable of handling non-Euclidean data. Extensive experimental analyses on a variety of benchmarks (i.e., ImageNet-1k classification, COCO 2017 detection and segmentation, CUHK03 person re-identification, CIFAR analysis, and Cora document categorization) demonstrate that ACNet cannot only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also overcome the limitation of the conventional MLP and CNN.

The adapted representations often do not capture pixel-level domain shifts that are crucial for dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). In this paper, we present a novel pixel-wise adversarial domain adaptation algorithm. By leveraging image-to-image translation methods for data augmentation, our key insight is that while the translated images between domains may differ in styles, their predictions for the task should be consistent. We exploit this property and introduce a cross-domain consistency loss that enforces our adapted model to produce consistent predictions. Through extensive experimental results, we show that our method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art on a wide variety of unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CrDoCo:,Pixel-Level,Domain,Transfer,With,Cross-Domain,Consistency"

The method trains a network using temporal cycle-consistency (TCC), a differentiable cycle-consistency loss that can be used to find correspondences across time in multiple videos. The resulting per-frame embeddings can be used to align videos by simply matching frames using nearest-neighbors in the learned embedding space.  To evaluate the power of the embeddings, we densely label the Pouring and Penn Action video datasets for action phases. We show that (i) the learned embeddings enable few-shot classification of these action phases, significantly reducing the supervised training requirements; and (ii) TCC is complementary to other methods of self-supervised learning in videos, such as Shuffle and Learn and Time-Contrastive Networks. The embeddings are also used for a number of applications based on alignment (dense temporal correspondence) between video pairs, including transfer of metadata of synchronized modalities between videos (sounds, temporal semantic labels), synchronized playback of multiple videos, and anomaly detection.

In this paper, we propose a unified generative adversarial network for predicting accurate and temporally consistent future frames over time, even in a challenging environment. The key idea is to train a single generator that can predict both future and past frames while enforcing the consistency of bi-directional prediction using the retrospective cycle constraints. Moreover, we employ two discriminators not only to identify fake frames but also to distinguish fake contained image sequences from the real sequence.  The latter discriminator, the sequence discriminator, plays a crucial role in predicting temporally consistent future frames.  We experimentally verify the proposed framework using various real-world videos captured by car-mounted cameras, surveillance cameras, and arbitrary devices with state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Predicting,Future,Frames,Using,Retrospective,Cycle,GAN"

Specifically, to improve the robustness of detection-based approaches for small/tiny heads, we leverage density map to improve the head/non-head classification in detection network where density map serves as the probability of a pixel being a head. A depth-adaptive kernel that considers the variances in head sizes is also introduced to generate high-fidelity density map for more robust density map regression. Further, a depth-aware anchor is designed for better initialization of anchor sizes in detection framework. Then we use the bounding boxes whose sizes are estimated with depth to train our RDNet. The existing RGB-D datasets are too small and not suitable for performance evaluation on data-driven based approaches, we collect a large-scale RGB-D crowd counting dataset. Experiments on both our RGB-D dataset and the MICC RGB-D counting dataset show that our method achieves the best performance for RGB-D crowd counting and localization. Further, our method can be readily extended to RGB image based crowd counting and achieves comparable performance on the ShanghaiTech Part_B dataset for both counting and localization.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Density,Map,Regression,Guided,Detection,Network,for,RGB-D,Crowd,Counting,and,Localization"
184,TAFE-Net: Task-Aware Feature Embeddings for Low Shot Learning,"Learning good feature embeddings for images often requires substantial training data. As a consequence, in settings where training data is limited (e.g., few-shot and zero-shot learning), we are typically forced to use a general feature embedding across prediction tasks. Ideally, we would like to construct feature embeddings that are tuned for the given task and even input image. In this work, we propose Task Aware Feature Embedding Networks (TAFE-Nets) to learn how to adapt the image representation to a new task in a meta learning fashion. Our network is composed of a meta learner and a prediction network, where the meta learner generates parameters for the feature layers in the prediction network based on a task input so that the feature embedding can be accurately adjusted for that task. We show that TAFE-Net is highly effective in generalizing to new tasks or concepts and evaluate the TAFE-Net on a range of benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot learning. Our model matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art on all tasks. In particular, our approach improves the prediction accuracy of unseen attribute-object pairs by 4 to 15 points on the challenging visual attribute-object composition task.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"TAFE-Net:,Task-Aware,Feature,Embeddings,for,Low,Shot,Learning"

Such synthetic images and semantic labels can be easily generated from virtual 3D environments. In this work, we propose an approach to cross-domain semantic segmentation with the auxiliary geometric information, which can also be easily obtained from virtual environments. The geometric information is utilized on two levels for reducing domain shift: on the input level, we augment the standard image translation network with the geometric information to translate synthetic images into realistic style; on the output level, we build a task network which simultaneously performs semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Meanwhile, adversarial training is applied on the joint output space to preserve the correlation between semantics and depth. The proposed approach is validated on two pairs of synthetic to real dataset: from Virtual KITTI to KITTI, and from SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, where we achieve a clear performance gain compared to the baselines and various competing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the geometric information for cross-domain semantic segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Semantic,Segmentation,From,Synthetic,Data:,A,Geometrically,Guided,Input-Output,Adaptation,Approach"

The network thus modifies its behaviour through task-dependent feature adaptation, or task attention. This gives the network the ability to accentuate the features that are adapted to a task, while shunning irrelevant ones. We further reduce task interference by forcing the task gradients to be statistically indistinguishable through adversarial training, ensuring that the common backbone architecture serving all tasks is not dominated by any of the task-specific gradients. Results in three multi-task dense labelling problems consistently show: (i) a large reduction in the number of parameters while preserving, or even improving performance and (ii) a smooth trade-off between computation and multi-task accuracy.

The architecture can be trained end-to-end and can be built upon any feed-forward neural network, is simple to implement, and is parameter efficient. We evaluate our approach on a variety of datasets, across both image-to-image predictions and image classification tasks.

Various self-supervised algorithms have leveraged the motion cues to learn effective visual representations. The hurdle here is that motion is both ambiguous and complex, rendering previous works either suffer from degraded learning efficacy, or resort to strong assumptions on object motions. In this work, we design a new learning-from-motion paradigm to bridge these gaps. Instead of explicitly modeling the motion probabilities, we design the pretext task as a conditional motion propagation problem. Given an input image and several sparse flow guidance on it, our framework seeks to recover the full-image motion. Compared to other alternatives, our framework has several appealing properties: (1) Using sparse flow guidance during training resolves the inherent motion ambiguity, and thus easing feature learning. (2) Solving the pretext task of conditional motion propagation encourages the emergence of kinematically-sound representations that poss greater expressive power. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework learns structural and coherent features; and achieves state-of-the-art self-supervision performance on several downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and human parsing.

Existing approaches have been focused on the unsupervised setting due to the limited resource to obtain the large-scale ground truth data. To construct a self-learnable objective, co-related tasks are often linked together to form a joint framework. However, the prior work usually utilizes independent networks for each task, thus not allowing to learn shared feature representations across models. In this paper, we propose a single and principled network to jointly learn spatiotemporal correspondence for stereo matching and flow estimation, with a newly designed geometric connection as the unsupervised signal for temporally adjacent stereo pairs. We show that our method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art baselines for both unsupervised depth and flow estimation on the KITTI benchmark dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bridging,Stereo,Matching,and,Optical,Flow,via,Spatiotemporal,Correspondence"

We consider spatial contexts, for which we solve so-called jigsaw puzzles, i.e., each image is cut into grids and then disordered, and the goal is to recover the correct configuration. Existing approaches formulated it as a classification task by defining a fixed mapping from a small subset of configurations to a class set, but these approaches ignore the underlying relationship between different configurations and also limit their applications to more complex scenarios.  This paper presents a novel approach which applies to jigsaw puzzles with an arbitrary grid size and dimensionality. We provide a fundamental and generalized principle, that weaker cues are easier to be learned in an unsupervised manner and also transfer better. In the context of puzzle recognition, we use an iterative manner which, instead of solving the puzzle all at once, adjusts the order of the patches in each step until convergence. In each step, we combine both unary and binary features of each patch into a cost function judging the correctness of the current configuration. Our approach, by taking similarity between puzzles into consideration, enjoys a more efficient way of learning visual knowledge. We verify the effectiveness of our approach from two aspects. First, it solves arbitrarily complex puzzles, including high-dimensional puzzles, that prior methods are difficult to handle. Second, it serves as a reliable way of network initialization, which leads to better transfer performance in visual recognition tasks including classification, detection and segmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Iterative,Reorganization,With,Weak,Spatial,Constraints:,Solving,Arbitrary,Jigsaw,Puzzles,for,Unsupervised,Representation,Learning"
193,Revisiting Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning,"Unsupervised visual representation learning remains a largely unsolved problem in computer vision research. Among a big body of recently proposed approaches for unsupervised learning of visual representations, a class of self-supervised techniques achieves superior performance on many challenging benchmarks. A large number of the pretext tasks for self-supervised learning have been studied, but other important aspects, such as the choice of convolutional neural networks (CNN), has not received equal attention. Therefore, we revisit numerous previously proposed self-supervised models, conduct a thorough large scale study and, as a result, uncover multiple crucial insights. We challenge a number of common practices in self-supervised visual representation learning and observe that standard recipes for CNN design do not always translate to self-supervised representation learning. As part of our study, we drastically boost the performance of previously proposed techniques and outperform previously published state-of-the-art results by a large margin. We will release the code for reproducing our experiments when the anonymity requirements are lifted.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Revisiting,Self-Supervised,Visual,Representation,Learning"
194,It's Not About the Journey; It's About the Destination: Following Soft Paths Under Question-Guidance for Visual Reasoning,"Visual Reasoning remains a challenging task, as it has to deal with long-range and multi-step object relationships in the scene. We present a new model for Visual Reasoning, aimed at capturing the interplay among individual objects in the image represented as a scene graph. As not all graph components are relevant for the query, we introduce the concept of a question-based visual guide, which constrains the potential solution space by learning an optimal traversal scheme, where the final destination nodes alone are used to produce the answer. We show, that finding relevant semantic structures facilitates generalization to new tasks by introducing a novel problem of knowledge transfer: training on one question type and answering questions from a different domain without any training data. Furthermore, we report state-of-the-art results for Visual Reasoning on multiple query types and diverse image and video datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"It's,Not,About,the,Journey;,It's,About,the,Destination:,Following,Soft,Paths,Under,Question-Guidance,for,Visual,Reasoning"
195,Actively Seeking and Learning From Live Data,"One of the key limitations of traditional machine learning methods is their requirement for training data that exemplifies all the information to be learned. This is a particular problem for visual question answering methods, which may be asked questions about virtually anything. The approach we propose is a step toward overcoming this limitation by searching for the information required at test time. The resulting method dynamically utilizes data from an external source, such as a large set of questions/answers or images/captions. Concretely, we learn a set of base weights for a simple VQA model, that are specifically adapted to a given question with the information specifically retrieved for this question. The adaptation process leverages recent advances in gradient-based meta learning and contributions for efficient retrieval and cross-domain adaptation. We surpass the state-of-the-art on the VQA-CP v2 benchmark and demonstrate our approach to be intrinsically more robust to out-of-distribution test data. We demonstrate the use of external non-VQA data using the MS COCO captioning dataset to support the answering process. This approach opens a new avenue for open-domain VQA systems that interface with diverse sources of data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Actively,Seeking,and,Learning,From,Live,Data"
196,Improving Referring Expression Grounding With Cross-Modal Attention-Guided Erasing,"Referring expression grounding aims at locating certain objects or persons in an image with a referring expression, where the key challenge is to comprehend and align various types of information from visual and textual domain, such as visual attributes, location and interactions with surrounding regions. Although the attention mechanism has been successfully applied for cross-modal alignments, previous attention models focus on only the most dominant features of both modalities, and neglect the fact that there could be multiple comprehensive textual-visual correspondences between images and referring expressions. To tackle this issue, we design a novel cross-modal attention-guided erasing approach, where we discard the most dominant information from either textual or visual domains to generate difficult training samples online, and to drive the model to discover complementary textual-visual correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on three referring expression grounding datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Improving,Referring,Expression,Grounding,With,Cross-Modal,Attention-Guided,Erasing"

As a language-to-vision matching task, the key to this problem is to learn a discriminative object feature that can adapt to the expression used. To avoid ambiguity, the expression normally tends to describe not only the properties of the referent itself, but also its relationships to its neighbourhood. To capture and exploit this important information we propose a graph-based, language-guided attention mechanism. Being composed of node attention component and edge attention component, the proposed graph attention mechanism explicitly represents inter-object relationships, and properties with a flexibility and power impossible with competing approaches. Furthermore, the proposed graph attention mechanism enables the comprehension decision to be visualizable and explainable. Experiments on three referring expression comprehension datasets show the advantage of the proposed approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Neighbourhood,Watch:,Referring,Expression,Comprehension,via,Language-Guided,Graph,Attention,Networks"
198,Scene Graph Generation With External Knowledge and Image Reconstruction,"Scene graph generation has received growing attention with the advancements in image understanding tasks such as object detection, attributes and relationship prediction, etc. However, existing datasets are biased in terms of object and relationship labels, or often come with noisy and missing annotations, which makes the development of a reliable scene graph prediction model very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel scene graph generation algorithm with external knowledge and image reconstruction loss to overcome these dataset issues. In particular, we extract commonsense knowledge from the external knowledge base to refine object and phrase features for improving generalizability in scene graph generation. To address the bias of noisy object annotations, we introduce an auxiliary image reconstruction path to regularize the scene graph generation network. Extensive experiments show that our framework can generate better scene graphs, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets: Visual Relationship Detection and Visual Genome datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Scene,Graph,Generation,With,External,Knowledge,and,Image,Reconstruction"
199,Polysemous Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Visual-semantic embedding aims to find a shared latent space where related visual and textual instances are close to each other. Most current methods learn injective embedding functions that map an instance to a single point in the shared space. Unfortunately, injective embedding cannot effectively handle polysemous instances with multiple possible meanings; at best, it would find an average representation of different meanings. This hinders its use in real-world scenarios where individual instances and their cross-modal associations are often ambiguous. In this work, we introduce Polysemous Instance Embedding Networks (PIE-Nets) that compute multiple and diverse representations of an instance by combining global context with locally-guided features via multi-head self-attention and residual learning. To learn visual-semantic embedding, we tie-up two PIE-Nets and optimize them jointly in the multiple instance learning framework. Most existing work on cross-modal retrieval focus on image-text pairs of data. Here, we also tackle a more challenging case of video-text retrieval. To facilitate further research in video-text retrieval, we release a new dataset of 50K video-sentence pairs collected from social media, dubbed MRW (my reaction when). We demonstrate our approach on both image-text and video-text retrieval scenarios using MS-COCO, TGIF, and our new MRW dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Polysemous,Visual-Semantic,Embedding,for,Cross-Modal,Retrieval"
200,MUREL: Multimodal Relational Reasoning for Visual Question Answering,"Multimodal attentional networks are currently state-of-the-art models for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks involving real images. Although attention allows to focus on the visual content relevant to the question, this simple mechanism is arguably insufficient to model complex reasoning features required for VQA or other high-level tasks.  In this paper, we propose MuRel, a multimodal relational network which is learned end-to-end to reason over real images. Our first contribution is the introduction of the MuRel cell, an atomic reasoning primitive representing interactions between question and image regions by a rich vectorial representation, and modeling region relations with pairwise combinations. Secondly, we incorporate the cell into a full MuRel network, which progressively refines visual and question interactions, and can be leveraged to define visualization schemes finer than mere attention maps.  We validate the relevance of our approach with various ablation studies, and show its superiority to attention-based methods on three datasets: VQA 2.0, VQA-CP v2 and TDIUC. Our final MuRel network is competitive to or outperforms state-of-the-art results in this challenging context.

Our VideoQA model firstly generates the global context-aware visual and textual features respectively by interacting current inputs with memory contents. After that, it makes the attentional fusion of the multimodal visual and textual representations to infer the correct answer. Multiple cycles of reasoning can be made to iteratively refine attention weights of the multimodal data and improve the final representation of the QA pair. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four VideoQA benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Heterogeneous,Memory,Enhanced,Multimodal,Attention,Model,for,Video,Question,Answering"
202,Information Maximizing Visual Question Generation,"Though image-to-sequence generation models have become overwhelmingly popular in human-computer communications, they suffer from strongly favoring safe generic questions (""What is in this picture?""). Generating uninformative but relevant questions is not sufficient or useful. We argue that a good question is one that has a tightly focused purpose --- one that is aimed at expecting a specific type of response. We build a model that maximizes mutual information between the image, the expected answer and the generated question. To overcome the non-differentiability of discrete natural language tokens, we introduce a variational continuous latent space onto which the expected answers project. We regularize this latent space with a second latent space that ensures clustering of similar answers. Even when we don't know the expected answer, this second latent space can generate goal-driven questions specifically aimed at extracting objects (""what is the person throwing""),  attributes, (""What kind of shirt is the person wearing?""), color (""what color is the frisbee?""), material (""What material is the frisbee?""), etc. We quantitatively show that our model is able to retain information about an expected answer category, resulting in more diverse, goal-driven questions.

203,Learning to Detect Human-Object Interactions With Knowledge,"The recent advances in instance-level detection tasks lay a strong foundation for automated visual scenes understanding. However, the ability to fully comprehend a social scene still eludes us. In this work, we focus on detecting human-object interactions (HOIs) in images, an essential step towards deeper scene understanding. HOI detection aims to localize human and objects, as well as to identify the complex interactions between them. Innate in practical problems with large label space, HOI categories exhibit a long-tail distribution, i.e., there exist some rare categories with very few training samples. Given the key observation that HOIs contain intrinsic semantic regularities despite they are visually diverse, we tackle the challenge of long-tail HOI categories by modeling the underlying regularities among verbs and objects in HOIs as well as general relationships. In particular, we construct a knowledge graph based on the ground-truth annotations of training dataset and external source. In contrast to direct knowledge incorporation, we address the necessity of dynamic image-specific knowledge retrieval by multi-modal learning, which leads to an enhanced semantic embedding space for HOI comprehension. The proposed method shows improved performance on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks, especially when predicting the rare HOI categories.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Detect,Human-Object,Interactions,With,Knowledge"
204,Learning Words by Drawing Images,"We propose a framework for learning through drawing. Our goal is to learn the correspondence between spoken words and abstract visual attributes, from a dataset of spoken descriptions of images. Building upon recent findings that GAN representations can be manipulated to edit semantic concepts in the generated output, we propose a new method to use such GAN-generated images to train a model using a triplet loss.  To apply the method, we develop Audio CLEVRGAN, a new dataset of audio descriptions of GAN-generated CLEVR images, and we describe a training procedure that creates a curriculum of GAN-generated images that focuses training on image pairs that differ in a specific, informative way. Training is done without additional supervision beyond the spoken captions and the GAN. We find that training that takes advantage of GAN-generated edited examples results in improvements in the model's ability to learn attributes compared to previous results. Our proposed learning framework also results in models that can associate spoken words with some abstract visual concepts such as color and size.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Words,by,Drawing,Images"
205,Factor Graph Attention,"Dialog is an effective way to exchange information, but subtle details and nuances are extremely important. While significant progress has paved a path   to address visual dialog with algorithms,  details and nuances remain a challenge. Attention mechanisms have demonstrated compelling results to extract details in visual question answering and also provide a convincing framework for visual dialog due to their interpretability and effectiveness. However, the many data utilities that accompany visual dialog challenge  existing attention techniques. We address this issue and develop a general attention mechanism for visual dialog which operates on any number of data utilities. To this end, we design a factor graph based attention mechanism which combines any number of utility representations. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach on the challenging and recently introduced VisDial datasets, outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods by 1.1% for VisDial0.9 and by 2% for VisDial1.0 on MRR. Our ensemble model improved the MRR score on VisDial1.0 by more than 6%.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Factor,Graph,Attention"
206,Reducing Uncertainty in Undersampled MRI Reconstruction With Active Acquisition,"The goal of MRI reconstruction is to restore a high fidelity image from partially observed measurements. This partial view naturally induces reconstruction uncertainty that can only be reduced by acquiring additional measurements. In this paper, we present a novel method for MRI reconstruction that, at inference time, dynamically selects the measurements to take and iteratively refines the prediction in order to best reduce the reconstruction error and, thus, its uncertainty. We validate our method on a large scale knee MRI dataset, as well as on ImageNet. Results show that (1) our system successfully outperforms active acquisition baselines; (2) our uncertainty estimates correlate with error maps; and (3) our ResNet-based architecture surpasses standard pixel-to-pixel models in the task of MRI reconstruction. The proposed method not only shows high-quality reconstructions but also paves the road towards more applicable solutions for accelerating MRI.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Reducing,Uncertainty,in,Undersampled,MRI,Reconstruction,With,Active,Acquisition"
207,ESIR: End-To-End Scene Text Recognition via Iterative Image Rectification,"Automated recognition of texts in scenes has been a research challenge for years, largely due to the arbitrary text appearance variation in perspective distortion, text line curvature, text styles and different types of imaging artifacts. The recent deep networks are capable of learning robust representations with respect to imaging artifacts and text style changes, but still face various problems while dealing with scene texts with perspective and curvature distortions. This paper presents an end-to-end trainable scene text recognition system (ESIR) that iteratively removes perspective distortion and text line curvature as driven by better scene text recognition performance. An innovative rectification network is developed, where a line-fitting transformation is designed to estimate the pose of text lines in scenes. Additionally, an iterative rectification framework is developed which corrects scene text distortions iteratively towards a fronto-parallel view. The ESIR is also robust to parameter initialization and easy to train, where the training needs only scene text images and word-level annotations as required by most scene text recognition systems. Extensive experiments over a number of public datasets show that the proposed ESIR is capable of rectifying scene text distortions accurately, achieving superior recognition performance for both normal scene text images and those suffering from perspective and curvature distortions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ESIR:,End-To-End,Scene,Text,Recognition,via,Iterative,Image,Rectification"

We propose a novel loss formulation by lifting 2D detection, orientation, and scale estimation into 3D space. Instead of optimizing these quantities separately, the 3D instantiation allows to properly measure the metric misalignment of boxes. We experimentally show that our 10D lifting of sparse 2D Regions of Interests (RoIs) achieves great results both for 6D pose and recovery of the textured metric geometry of instances. This further enables 3D synthetic data augmentation via inpainting recovered meshes directly onto the 2D scenes. We evaluate on KITTI3D against other strong monocular methods and demonstrate that our approach doubles the AP on the 3D pose metrics on the official test set, defining the new state of the art.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ROI-10D:,Monocular,Lifting,of,2D,Detection,to,6D,Pose,and,Metric,Shape"
209,Collaborative Learning of Semi-Supervised Segmentation and Classification for Medical Images,"Medical image analysis has two important research areas: disease grading and fine-grained lesion segmentation. Although the former problem often relies on the latter, the two are usually studied separately. Disease severity grading can be treated as a classification problem, which only requires image-level annotations, while the lesion segmentation requires stronger pixel-level annotations. However, pixel-wise data annotation for medical images is highly time-consuming and requires domain experts. In this paper, we propose a collaborative learning method to jointly improve the performance of disease grading and lesion segmentation by semi-supervised learning with an attention mechanism.  Given a small set of pixel-level annotated data, a multi-lesion mask generation model first performs the traditional semantic segmentation task. Then, based on initially predicted lesion maps for large quantities of image-level annotated data, a lesion attentive disease grading model is designed to improve the severity classification accuracy. Meanwhile, the lesion attention model can refine the lesion maps using class-specific information to fine-tune the segmentation model in a semi-supervised manner. An adversarial architecture is also integrated for training. With extensive experiments on a representative medical problem called diabetic retinopathy (DR), we validate the effectiveness of our method and achieve consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Collaborative,Learning,of,Semi-Supervised,Segmentation,and,Classification,for,Medical,Images"
210,Biologically-Constrained Graphs for Global Connectomics Reconstruction,"Most current state-of-the-art connectome reconstruction pipelines have two major steps: initial pixel-based segmentation with affinity prediction and watershed transform, and refined segmentation by merging over-segmented regions. These methods rely only on local context and are typically agnostic to the underlying biology. Since a few merge errors can lead to several incorrectly merged neuronal processes, these algorithms are currently tuned towards over-segmentation producing an overburden of costly proofreading. We propose a third step for connectomics reconstruction pipelines to refine an over-segmentation using both local and global context with an emphasis on adhering to the underlying biology. We first extract a graph from an input segmentation where nodes correspond to segment labels and edges indicate potential split errors in the over-segmentation. In order to increase throughput and allow for large-scale reconstruction, we employ biologically inspired geometric constraints based on neuron morphology to reduce the number of nodes and edges. Next, two neural networks learn these neuronal shapes to further aid the graph construction process. Lastly, we reformulate the region merging problem as a graph partitioning one to leverage global context. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on four real-world connectomics datasets with an average variation of information improvement of 21.3%.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Biologically-Constrained,Graphs,for,Global,Connectomics,Reconstruction"
211,P3SGD: Patient Privacy Preserving SGD for Regularizing Deep CNNs in Pathological Image Classification,"Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in pathological image classification. However, due to the limited number of labeled pathological images, there are still two challenges to be addressed: (1) overfitting: the performance of a CNN model is undermined by the overfitting due to its huge amounts of parameters and the insufficiency of labeled training data. (2) privacy leakage: the model trained using a conventional method may involuntarily reveal the private information of the patients in the training dataset. The smaller the dataset, the worse the privacy leakage.  To tackle the above two challenges, we introduce a novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) scheme, named patient privacy preserving SGD (P3SGD), which performs the model update of the SGD in the patient level via a large-step update built upon each patient's data. Specifically, to protect privacy and regularize the CNN model, we propose to inject the well-designed noise into the updates. Moreover, we equip our P3SGD with an elaborated strategy to adaptively control the scale of the injected noise. To validate the effectiveness of P3SGD, we perform extensive experiments on a real-world clinical dataset and quantitatively demonstrate the superior ability of P3SGD in reducing the risk of overfitting. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the privacy cost under differential privacy. Additionally, we find that the models trained with P3SGD are resistant to the model-inversion attack compared with those trained using non-private SGD.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"P3SGD:,Patient,Privacy,Preserving,SGD,for,Regularizing,Deep,CNNs,in,Pathological,Image,Classification"
212,Elastic Boundary Projection for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"We focus on an important yet challenging problem: using a 2D deep network to deal with 3D segmentation for medical image analysis. Existing approaches either applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D) networks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot capture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and less stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models.  In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach named Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although the object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its boundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in the 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object boundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around each pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network to determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually adjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the boundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation. EBP allows boundary-based segmentation without cutting a 3D volume into slices or patches, which stands out from conventional 2D and 3D approaches. EBP achieves promising accuracy in abdominal organ segmentation.

213,SIXray: A Large-Scale Security Inspection X-Ray Benchmark for Prohibited Item Discovery in Overlapping Images,"In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset and establish a baseline for prohibited item discovery in Security Inspection X-ray images. Our dataset, named SIXray, consists of 1,059,231 X-ray images, in which 6 classes of 8,929 prohibited items are manually annotated. It raises a brand new challenge of overlapping image data, meanwhile shares the same properties with existing datasets, including complex yet meaningless contexts and class imbalance. We propose an approach named class-balanced hierarchical refinement (CHR) to deal with these difficulties. CHR assumes that each input image is sampled from a mixture distribution, and that deep networks require an iterative process to infer image contents accurately. To accelerate, we insert reversed connections to different network backbones, delivering high-level visual cues to assist mid-level features. In addition, a class-balanced loss function is designed to maximally alleviate the noise introduced by easy negative samples. We evaluate CHR on SIXray with different ratios of positive/negative samples. Compared to the baselines, CHR enjoys a better ability of discriminating objects especially using mid-level features, which offers the possibility of using a weakly-supervised approach towards accurate object localization. In particular, the advantage of CHR is more significant in the scenarios with fewer positive training samples, which demonstrates its potential application in real-world security inspection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SIXray:,A,Large-Scale,Security,Inspection,X-Ray,Benchmark,for,Prohibited,Item,Discovery,in,Overlapping,Images"
214,Noise2Void - Learning Denoising From Single Noisy Images,"The field of image denoising is currently dominated by discriminative deep learning methods that are trained on pairs of noisy input and clean target images. Recently it has been shown that such methods can also be trained without clean targets. Instead, independent pairs of noisy images can be used, in an approach known as Noise2Noise (N2N). Here, we introduce Noise2Void (N2V), a training scheme that takes this idea one step further. It does not require noisy image pairs, nor clean target images. Consequently, N2V allows us to train directly on the body of data to be denoised and can therefore be applied when other methods cannot. Especially interesting is the application to biomedical image data, where the acquisition of training targets, clean or noisy, is frequently not possible. We compare the performance of N2V to approaches that have either clean target images and/or noisy image pairs available. Intuitively, N2V cannot be expected to outperform methods that have more information available during training. Still, we observe that the denoising performance of Noise2Void drops in moderation and compares favorably to training-free denoising methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Noise2Void,-,Learning,Denoising,From,Single,Noisy,Images"
215,Joint Discriminative and Generative Learning for Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (re-id) remains challenging due to significant intra-class variations across different cameras. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using generative models to augment training data and enhance the invariance to input changes. The generative pipelines in existing methods, however, stay relatively separate from the discriminative re-id learning stages. Accordingly, re-id models are often trained in a straightforward manner on the generated data. In this paper, we seek to improve learned re-id embeddings by better leveraging the generated data. To this end, we propose a joint learning framework that couples re-id learning and data generation end-to-end. Our model involves a generative module that separately encodes each person into an appearance code and a structure code, and a discriminative module that shares the appearance encoder with the generative module. By switching the appearance or structure codes, the generative module is able to generate high-quality cross-id composed images, which are online fed back to the appearance encoder and used to improve the discriminative module. The proposed joint learning framework renders significant improvement over the baseline without using generated data, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Joint,Discriminative,and,Generative,Learning,for,Person,Re-Identification"

To overcome this problem, we propose a deep model for the soft multilabel learning for unsupervised RE-ID. The idea is to learn a soft multilabel (real-valued label likelihood vector) for each unlabeled person by comparing the unlabeled person with a set of known reference persons from an auxiliary domain. We propose the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining to learn a discriminative embedding for the unlabeled target domain by exploring the similarity consistency of the visual features and the soft multilabels of unlabeled target pairs. Since most target pairs are cross-view pairs, we develop the cross-view consistent soft multilabel learning to achieve the learning goal that the soft multilabels are consistently good across different camera views. To enable effecient soft multilabel learning, we introduce the reference agent learning to represent each reference person by a reference agent in a joint embedding. We evaluate our unified deep model on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised RE-ID methods by clear margins.

However, most previous methods focus on learning individual appearance feature embedding, and it is hard for the models to handle difficult situations with different illumination, large pose variance and occlusion. In this work, we take a step further and consider employing context information for person search. For a probe-gallery pair, we first propose a contextual instance expansion module, which employs a relative attention module to search and filter useful context information in the scene. We also build a graph learning framework to effectively employ context pairs to update target similarity. These two modules are built on top of a joint detection and instance feature learning framework, which improves the discriminativeness of the learned features.

218,Gradient Matching Generative Networks for Zero-Shot Learning,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is one of the most promising problems where substantial progress can potentially be achieved through unsupervised learning, due to distributional differences between supervised and zero-shot classes. For this reason, several works investigate the incorporation of discriminative domain adaptation techniques into ZSL, which, however, lead to modest improvements in ZSL accuracy. In contrast, we propose a generative model that can naturally learn from unsupervised examples, and synthesize training examples for unseen classes purely based on their class embeddings, and therefore, reduce the zero-shot learning problem into a supervised classification task. The proposed approach consists of two important components: (i) a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that learns to produce samples that mimic the characteristics of unsupervised data examples, and (ii) the Gradient Matching (GM) loss that measures the quality of the gradient signal obtained from the synthesized examples.

219,Doodle to Search: Practical Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), where human sketches are used as queries to conduct retrieval of photos from unseen categories. We importantly advance prior arts by proposing a novel ZS-SBIR scenario that represents a firm step forward in its practical application. The new setting uniquely recognizes two important yet often neglected challenges of practical ZS-SBIR, (i) the large domain gap between amateur sketch and photo, and (ii) the necessity for moving towards large-scale retrieval. We first contribute to the community a novel ZS-SBIR dataset, QuickDraw-Extended, that consists of 330,000 sketches and 204,000 photos spanning across 110 categories. Highly abstract amateur human sketches are purposefully sourced to maximize the domain gap, instead of ones included in existing datasets that can often be semi-photorealistic. We then formulate a ZS-SBIR framework to jointly model sketches and photos into a common embedding space. A novel strategy to mine the mutual information among domains is specifically engineered to alleviate the domain gap. External semantic knowledge is further embedded to aid semantic transfer. We show that, rather surprisingly, retrieval performance significantly outperforms that of state-of-the-art on existing datasets that can already be achieved using a reduced version of our model. We further demonstrate the superior performance of our full model by comparing with a number of alternatives on the newly proposed dataset. The new dataset, plus all training and testing code of our model, will be publicly released to facilitate future research.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Doodle,to,Search:,Practical,Zero-Shot,Sketch-Based,Image,Retrieval"
220,Zero-Shot Task Transfer,"In this work, we present a novel meta-learning algorithm that regresses model parameters for novel tasks for which no ground truth is available (zero-shot tasks). In order to adapt to novel zero-shot tasks, our meta-learner learns from the model parameters of known tasks (with ground truth) and the correlation of known tasks to zero-shot tasks. Such intuition finds its foothold in cognitive science, where a subject (human baby) can adapt to a novel concept (depth understanding) by correlating it with old concepts (hand movement or self-motion), without receiving an explicit supervision. We evaluated our model on the Taskonomy dataset, with four tasks as zero-shot: surface normal, room layout, depth and camera pose estimation. These tasks were chosen based on the data acquisition complexity and the complexity associated with the learning process using a deep network. Our proposed methodolgy outperforms state-of-the-art models (which use ground truth) on each of our zero-shot tasks, showing promise on zero-shot task transfer. We also conducted extensive experiments to study the various choices of our methodology, as well as showed how the proposed method can also be used in transfer learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such effort on zero-shot learning in the task space.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Zero-Shot,Task,Transfer"
221,C-MIL: Continuation Multiple Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Detection,"Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) is a challenging task when provided with image category supervision but required to simultaneously learn object locations and object detectors. Many WSOD approaches adopt multiple instance learning (MIL) and have non-convex loss functions which are prone to get stuck into local minima (falsely localize object parts) while missing full object extent during training. In this paper, we introduce a continuation optimization method into MIL and thereby creating continuation multiple instance learning (C-MIL), with the intention of alleviating the non-convexity problem in a systematic way. We partition instances into spatially related and class related subsets, and approximate the original loss function with a series of smoothed loss functions defined within the subsets. Optimizing smoothed loss functions prevents the training procedure falling prematurely into local minima and facilitates the discovery of Stable Semantic Extremal Regions (SSERs) which indicate full object extent. On the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets, C-MIL improves the state-of-the-art of weakly supervised object detection and weakly supervised object localization with large margins.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"C-MIL:,Continuation,Multiple,Instance,Learning,for,Weakly,Supervised,Object,Detection"
222,Weakly Supervised Learning of Instance Segmentation With Inter-Pixel Relations,"This paper presents a novel approach for learning instance segmentation with image-level class labels as supervision. Our approach generates pseudo instance segmentation labels of training images, which are used to train a fully supervised model. For generating the pseudo labels, we first identify confident seed areas of object classes from attention maps of an image classification model, and propagate them to discover the entire instance areas with accurate boundaries. To this end, we propose IRNet, which estimates rough areas of individual instances and detects boundaries between different object classes. It thus enables to assign instance labels to the seeds and to propagate them within the boundaries so that the entire areas of instances can be estimated accurately. Furthermore, IRNet is trained with inter-pixel relations on the attention maps, thus no extra supervision is required. Our method with IRNet achieves an outstanding performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing not only previous state-of-the-art trained with the same level of supervision, but also some of previous models relying on stronger supervision.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly,Supervised,Learning,of,Instance,Segmentation,With,Inter-Pixel,Relations"
223,Attention-Based Dropout Layer for Weakly Supervised Object Localization,"Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) techniques learn the object location only using image-level labels, without location annotations. A common limitation for these techniques is that they cover only the most discriminative part of the object, not the entire object. To address this problem, we propose an Attention-based Dropout Layer (ADL), which utilizes the self-attention mechanism to process the feature maps of the model. The proposed method is composed of two key components: 1) hiding the most discriminative part from the model for capturing the integral extent of object, and 2) highlighting the informative region for improving the recognition power of the model. Based on extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to improve the accuracy of WSOL, achieving a new state-of-the-art localization accuracy in CUB-200-2011 dataset. We also show that the proposed method is much more efficient in terms of both parameter and computation overheads than existing techniques.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attention-Based,Dropout,Layer,for,Weakly,Supervised,Object,Localization"
224,Domain Generalization by Solving Jigsaw Puzzles,"Human adaptability relies crucially on the ability to learn and merge knowledge both from supervised and unsupervised learning: the parents point out few important concepts, but then the children fill in the gaps on their own. This is particularly effective, because supervised learning can never be exhaustive and thus learning autonomously allows to discover invariances and regularities that help to generalize. In this paper we propose to apply a similar approach to the task of object recognition across domains: our model learns the semantic labels in a supervised fashion, and broadens its understanding of the data by learning from self-supervised signals how to solve a jigsaw puzzle on the same images. This secondary task helps the network to learn the concepts of spatial correlation while acting as a regularizer for the classification task. Multiple experiments on the PACS, VLCS, Office-Home and digits datasets confirm our intuition and show that this simple method  outperforms previous domain generalization and adaptation solutions. An ablation study further illustrates the inner workings of our approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Domain,Generalization,by,Solving,Jigsaw,Puzzles"
225,Transferrable Prototypical Networks for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"In this paper, we introduce a new idea for unsupervised domain adaptation via a remold of Prototypical Networks, which learn an embedding space and perform classification via a remold of the distances to the prototype of each class. Specifically, we present Transferrable Prototypical Networks (TPN) for adaptation such that the prototypes for each class in source and target domains are close in the embedding space and the score distributions predicted by prototypes separately on source and target data are similar. Technically, TPN initially matches each target example to the nearest prototype in the source domain and assigns an example a ""pseudo"" label. The prototype of each class could then be computed on source-only, target-only and source-target data, respectively. The optimization of TPN is end-to-end trained by jointly minimizing the distance across the prototypes on three types of data and KL-divergence of score distributions output by each pair of the prototypes. Extensive experiments are conducted on the transfers across MNIST, USPS and SVHN datasets, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, we obtain an accuracy of 80.4% of single model on VisDA 2017 dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Transferrable,Prototypical,Networks,for,Unsupervised,Domain,Adaptation"
226,Blending-Target Domain Adaptation by Adversarial Meta-Adaptation Networks,"(Unsupervised) Domain Adaptation (DA) seeks for classifying target instances when solely provided with source labeled and target unlabeled examples for training. Learning domain-invariant features helps to achieve this goal, whereas it underpins unlabeled samples drawn from a single or multiple explicit target domains (Multi-target DA). In this paper, we consider a more realistic transfer scenario: our target domain is comprised of multiple sub-targets implicitly blended with each other so that learners could not identify which sub-target each unlabeled sample belongs to. This Blending-target Domain Adaptation (BTDA) scenario commonly appears in practice and threatens the validities of existing DA algorithms, due to the presence of domain gaps and categorical misalignments among these hidden sub-targets.   To reap the transfer performance gains in this new scenario, we propose Adversarial Meta-Adaptation Network (AMEAN). AMEAN entails two adversarial transfer learning processes. The first is a conventional adversarial transfer to bridge our source and mixed target domains. To circumvent the intra-target category misalignment, the second process presents as ""learning to adapt"": It deploys an unsupervised meta-learner receiving target data and their ongoing feature-learning feedbacks, to discover target clusters as our ""meta-sub-target"" domains. This meta-sub-targets auto-design our meta-sub-target adaptation loss, which is capable to progressively eliminate the implicit category mismatching in our mixed target. We evaluate AMEAN and a variety of DA algorithms in three benchmarks under the BTDA setup. Empirical results show that BTDA is a quite challenging transfer setup for most existing DA algorithms, yet AMEAN significantly outperforms these state-of-the-art baselines and effectively restrains the negative transfer effects in BTDA.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Blending-Target,Domain,Adaptation,by,Adversarial,Meta-Adaptation,Networks"
227,ELASTIC: Improving CNNs With Dynamic Scaling Policies,"Scale variation has been a challenge from traditional to modern approaches in computer vision. Most solutions to scale issues have a similar theme: a set of intuitive and manually designed policies that are generic and fixed (e.g. SIFT or feature pyramid). We argue that the scaling policy should be learned from data. In this paper, we introduce Elastic, a simple, efficient and yet very effective approach to learn a dynamic scale policy from data. We formulate the scaling policy as a non-linear function inside the network's structure that (a) is learned from data, (b) is instance specific, (c) does not add extra computation, and (d) can be applied on any network architecture.  We applied Elastic to several state-of-the-art network architectures and showed consistent improvement without extra (sometimes even lower) computation on ImageNet classification, MSCOCO multi-label classification, and PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation. Our results show major improvement for images with scale challenges.

228,ScratchDet: Training Single-Shot Object Detectors From Scratch,"Current state-of-the-art object objectors are fine-tuned from the off-the-shelf networks pretrained on large-scale classification dataset ImageNet, which incurs some additional problems: 1) The classification and detection have different degrees of sensitivity to translation, resulting in the learning objective bias; 2) The architecture is limited by the classification network, leading to the inconvenience of modification. To cope with these problems, training detectors from scratch is a feasible solution. However, the detectors trained from scratch generally perform worse than the pretrained ones, even suffer from the convergence issue in training. In this paper, we explore to train object detectors from scratch robustly. By analysing the previous work on optimization landscape, we find that one of the overlooked points in current trained-from-scratch detector is the BatchNorm. Resorting to the stable and predictable gradient brought by BatchNorm, detectors can be trained from scratch stably while keeping the favourable performance independent to the network architecture. Taking this advantage, we are able to explore various types of networks for object detection, without suffering from the poor convergence. By extensive experiments and analyses on downsampling factor, we propose the Root-ResNet backbone network, which makes full use of the information from original images. Our ScratchDet achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO among all the train-from-scratch detectors and even performs better than several one-stage pretrained methods.

229,SFNet: Learning Object-Aware Semantic Correspondence,"We address the problem of semantic correspondence, that is, establishing a dense flow field between images depicting different instances of the same object or scene category. We propose to use images annotated with binary foreground masks and subjected to synthetic geometric deformations to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task. Using these masks as part of the supervisory signal offers a good compromise between semantic flow methods, where the amount of training data is limited by the cost of manually selecting point correspondences, and semantic alignment ones, where the regression of a single global geometric transformation between images may be sensitive to image-specific details such as background clutter. We propose a new CNN architecture, dubbed SFNet, which implements this idea. It leverages a new and differentiable version of the argmax function for end-to-end training, with a loss that combines mask and flow consistency with smoothness terms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms the state of the art on standard benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SFNet:,Learning,Object-Aware,Semantic,Correspondence"
230,Deep Metric Learning Beyond Binary Supervision,"Metric Learning for visual similarity has mostly adopted binary supervision indicating whether a pair of images are of the same class or not. Such a binary indicator covers only a limited subset of image relations, and is not sufficient to represent semantic similarity between images described by continuous and/or structured labels such as object poses, image captions, and scene graphs. Motivated by this, we present a novel method for deep metric learning using continuous labels. First, we propose a new triplet loss that allows distance ratios in the label space to be preserved in the learned metric space. The proposed loss thus enables our model to learn the degree of similarity rather than just the order. Furthermore, we design a triplet mining strategy adapted to metric learning with continuous labels. We address three different image retrieval tasks with continuous labels in terms of human poses, room layouts and image captions, and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Metric,Learning,Beyond,Binary,Supervision"
231,Learning to Cluster Faces on an Affinity Graph,"Face recognition sees remarkable progress in recent years, and its performance has reached a very high level. Taking it to a next level requires substantially larger data, which would involve prohibitive annotation cost. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data becomes an appealing alternative. Recent works have shown that clustering unlabeled faces is a promising approach, often leading to notable performance gains. Yet, how to effectively cluster, especially on a large-scale (i.e. million-level or above) dataset, remains an open question. A key challenge lies in the complex variations of cluster patterns, which make it difficult for conventional clustering methods to meet the needed accuracy. This work explores a novel approach, namely, learning to cluster instead of relying on hand-crafted criteria. Specifically, we propose a framework based on graph convolutional network, which combines a detection and a segmentation module to pinpoint face clusters. Experiments show that our method yields significantly more accurate face clusters, which, as a result, also lead to further performance gain in face recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Cluster,Faces,on,an,Affinity,Graph"
232,C2AE: Class Conditioned Auto-Encoder for Open-Set Recognition,"Models trained for classification often assume that all testing classes are known while training. As a result, when presented with an unknown class during testing, such closed-set assumption forces the model to classify it as one of the known classes. However, in a real world scenario, classification models are likely to encounter such examples. Hence, identifying those examples as unknown becomes critical to model performance. A potential solution to overcome this problem lies in a class of learning problems known as open-set recognition. It refers to the problem of identifying the unknown classes during testing, while maintaining performance on the known classes. In this paper, we propose an open-set recognition algorithm using class conditioned auto-encoders with novel training and testing methodologies. In this method, training procedure is divided in two sub-tasks, 1. closed-set classification and, 2. open-set identification (i.e. identifying a class as known or unknown). Encoder learns the first task following the closed-set classification training pipeline, whereas decoder learns the second task by reconstructing conditioned on class identity. Furthermore, we model reconstruction errors using the Extreme Value Theory of statistical modeling to find the threshold for identifying known/unknown class samples. Experiments performed on multiple image classification datasets show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the state of the art methods.

233,Shapes and Context: In-The-Wild Image Synthesis & Manipulation,"We introduce a data-driven model for interactively synthesizing in-the-wild images from semantic label input masks. Our approach is dramatically different from recent work in this space, in that we make use of no learning. Instead, our approach uses simple but classic tools for matching scene context, shapes, and parts to a stored library of exemplars. Though simple, this approach has several notable advantages over recent work: (1) because nothing is learned, it is not limited to specific training data distributions (such as cityscapes, facades, or faces); (2) it can synthesize arbitrarily high-resolution images, limited only by the resolution of the exemplar library; (3) by appropriately composing shapes and parts, it can generate an exponentially large set of viable candidate output images (that can say, be interactively searched by a user). We present results on the diverse COCO dataset, significantly outperforming learning-based approaches on standard image synthesis metrics. Finally, we explore user-interaction and user-controllability, demonstrating that our system can be used as a platform for user-driven content creation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Shapes,and,Context:,In-The-Wild,Image,Synthesis,&,Manipulation"

Previous studies have shown remarkable progresses on visual quality of the generated images. In this paper, we consider semantics from the input text descriptions in helping render photo-realistic images. However, diverse linguistic expressions pose challenges in extracting consistent semantics even they depict the same thing. To this end, we propose a novel photo-realistic text-to-image generation model that implicitly disentangles semantics to both fulfill the high-level semantic consistency and low-level semantic diversity. To be specific, we design (1) a Siamese mechanism in the discriminator to learn consistent high-level semantics, and (2) a visual-semantic embedding strategy by semantic-conditioned batch normalization to find diverse low-level semantics. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on CUB and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semantics,Disentangling,for,Text-To-Image,Generation"

Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the network, forcing the network to memorize the information throughout all the layers. Instead, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned affine transformation.  Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows users to easily control the style and content of image synthesis results as well as create multi-modal results.

The generator of the network comprises a sequence of Pose-Attentional Transfer Blocks that each transfers certain regions it attends to, generating the person image progressively. Compared with those in previous works, our generated person images possess better appearance consistency and shape consistency with the input images, thus significantly more realistic-looking. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed network are validated both qualitatively and quantitatively on Market-1501 and DeepFashion.

Unlike previous methods learning a rock-hard direct mapping between human bodies, we propose a new pathway to decompose the hard mapping into two more accessible subtasks, namely, semantic parsing transformation and appearance generation. Firstly, a semantic generative network is proposed to transform between semantic parsing maps, in order to simplify the non-rigid deformation learning. Secondly, an appearance generative network learns to synthesize semantic-aware textures. Thirdly, we demonstrate that training our framework in an end-to-end manner further refines the semantic maps and final results accordingly. Our method is generalizable to other semantic-aware person image generation tasks, e.g., clothing texture transfer and controlled image manipulation.

This is achieved through a deep architecture that decouples appearance and motion information. Our framework consists of three main modules: (i) a Keypoint Detector unsupervisely trained to extract object keypoints, (ii) a Dense Motion prediction network for generating dense heatmaps from sparse keypoints, in order to better encode motion information and (iii) a Motion Transfer Network, which uses the motion heatmaps and appearance information extracted from the input image to synthesize the output frames.

In particular, our system estimates an explicit two-dimensional texture map of the model surface. At the same time, it abstains from explicit shape modeling in 3D. Instead, at test time, the system uses a fully-convolutional network to directly map the configuration of body feature points w.r.t. the camera  to the 2D texture coordinates of individual pixels in the image frame. We show that such system  is capable of learning to generate realistic renderings while being trained on videos annotated with 3D poses and foreground masks.

In this paper we propose IM-Net: an interpolated motion neural network. We use an economic structured architecture and end-to-end training with multi-scale tailored losses. In particular, we formulate interpolated motion estimation as classification rather than regression. IM-Net outperforms previous methods by more than 1.3dB (PSNR) on a high resolution version of the recently introduced Vimeo triplet dataset.

Cycle consistency allows modeling the relationship between two distinct domains without paired data. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework, as an extension of latent space interpolation, to consider the intermediate region between two domains during translation. It is based on the fact that in a flat and smooth latent space, there exist many paths that connect two sample points. Properly selecting paths makes it possible to change only certain image attributes, which is useful for generating intermediate images between the two domains. We also show that this framework can be applied to multi-domain and multi-modal translation.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-Channel Attention SelectionGAN (SelectionGAN) that makes it possible to generate images of natural scenes in arbitrary viewpoints, based on an image of the scene and a novel semantic map. The proposed SelectionGAN explicitly utilizes the semantic information and consists of two stages. In the first stage, the condition image and the target semantic map are fed into a cycled semantic-guided generation network to produce initial coarse results. In the second stage, we refine the initial results by using a multi-channel attention selection mechanism. Moreover, uncertainty maps automatically learned from attentions are used to guide the pixel loss for better network optimization.

Finding the optimal GXY without paired data is an ill-posed problem, so appropriate constraints are required to obtain reasonable solutions. While some prominent constraints such as cycle consistency and distance preservation successfully constrain the solution space, they overlook the special properties of images that simple geometric transformations do not change the image's semantic structure. Based on this special property, we develop a geometry-consistent generative adversarial network (Gc-GAN), which enables one-sided unsupervised domain mapping. GcGAN takes the original image and its counterpart image transformed by a predefined geometric transformation as inputs and generates two images in the new domain coupled with the corresponding geometry-consistency constraint. The geometry-consistency constraint reduces the space of possible solutions while keep the correct solutions in the search space. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with the baseline (GAN alone) and the state-of-the-art methods including CycleGAN [66] and DistanceGAN [5] demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Geometry-Consistent,Generative,Adversarial,Networks,for,One-Sided,Unsupervised,Domain,Mapping"

At its core, our approach is based on a Cartesian 3D grid of persistent embedded features that learn to make use of the underlying 3D scene structure. Our approach combines insights from 3D geometric computer vision with recent advances in learning image-to-image mappings based on adversarial loss functions. DeepVoxels is supervised, without requiring a 3D reconstruction of the scene, using a 2D re-rendering loss and enforces perspective and multi-view geometry in a principled manner.

We assume a coarse geometry scan, along with corresponding images and camera poses. The key contribution of this work is an accurate and simultaneous retrieval of light sources and physically based material properties (e.g., diffuse reflectance, specular reflectance, roughness, etc.) for the purpose of editing and re-rendering the scene under new conditions. To this end, we introduce a novel optimization method using a differentiable Monte Carlo renderer that computes derivatives with respect to the estimated unknown illumination and material properties.

Layered video representations have the potential of accurately modelling realistic scenes but have so far required stringent assumptions on motion, lighting and shape. Here we propose a learning-based approach for multi-layered video representation: we introduce novel uncertainty-capturing 3D convolutional architectures and train them to separate blended videos.

Recently, their class conditional extensions (e.g., conditional GAN (cGAN) and auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN)) have attracted much attention owing to their ability to learn the disentangled representations and to improve the training stability. However, their training requires the availability of large-scale accurate class-labeled data, which are often laborious or impractical to collect in a real-world scenario. To remedy this, we propose a novel family of GANs called label-noise robust GANs (rGANs), which, by incorporating a noise transition model, can learn a clean label conditional generative distribution even when training labels are noisy. In particular, we propose two variants: rAC-GAN, which is a bridging model between AC-GAN and the label-noise robust classification model, and rcGAN, which is an extension of cGAN and solves this problem with no reliance on any classifier. In addition to providing the theoretical background, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our models through extensive experiments using diverse GAN configurations, various noise settings, and multiple evaluation metrics (in which we tested 402 conditions in total).",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Label-Noise,Robust,Generative,Adversarial,Networks"
249,DLOW: Domain Flow for Adaptation and Generalization,"In this work, we present a domain flow generation(DLOW) model to bridge two different domains by generating a continuous sequence of intermediate domains flowing from one domain to the other. The benefits of our DLOW model are two-fold. First, it is able to transfer source images into different styles in the intermediate domains. The transferred images smoothly bridge the gap between source and target domains, thus easing the domain adaptation task. Second, when multiple target domains are provided for training, our DLOW model is also able to generate new styles of images that are unseen in the training data. We implement our DLOW model based on CycleGAN. A domainness variable is introduced to guide the model to generate the desired intermediate domain images. In the inference phase, a flow of various styles of images can be obtained by varying the domainness variable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for both cross-domain semantic segmentation and the style generalization tasks on benchmark datasets.

250,CollaGAN: Collaborative GAN for Missing Image Data Imputation,"In many applications requiring multiple inputs to obtain a desired output, if any of the input data is missing, it often introduces large amounts of bias. Although many techniques have been developed for imputing missing data, the image imputation is still difficult due to complicated nature of natural images. To address this problem, here we proposed a novel framework for missing image data imputation, called Collaborative Generative Adversarial Network (CollaGAN). CollaGAN convert the image imputation problem to a multi-domain images-to-image translation task so that a single generator and discriminator network can successfully estimate the missing data using the remaining clean data set. We demonstrate that CollaGAN produces the images with a higher visual quality compared to the existing competing approaches in various image imputation tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CollaGAN:,Collaborative,GAN,for,Missing,Image,Data,Imputation"
251,d-SNE: Domain Adaptation Using Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding,"On the one hand, deep neural networks are effective in learning large datasets. On the other, they are inefficient with their data usage. They often require copious amount of labeled-data to train their scads of parameters. Training larger and deeper networks is hard without appropriate regularization, particularly while using a small dataset. Laterally, collecting well-annotated data is expensive, time-consuming and often infeasible. A popular way to regularize these networks is to simply train the network with more data from an alternate representative dataset. This can lead to adverse effects if the statistics of the representative dataset are dissimilar to our target.This predicament is due to the problem of domain shift. Data from a shifted domain might not produce bespoke features when a feature extractor from the representative domain is used.   Several techniques of domain adaptation have been proposed in the past to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a new technique  (d-SNE) of domain adaptation that cleverly uses stochastic neighborhood embedding techniques and a novel modified-Hausdorff distance. The proposed technique is learnable end-to-end and is therefore, ideally suited to train neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that d-SNE outperforms the current states-of-the-art and is robust to the variances in different datasets, even in the one-shot and semi-supervised learning settings. d-SNE also demonstrates the ability to generalize to multiple domains concurrently.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"d-SNE:,Domain,Adaptation,Using,Stochastic,Neighborhood,Embedding"
252,Taking a Closer Look at Domain Shift: Category-Level Adversaries for Semantics Consistent Domain Adaptation,"We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. The key in this campaign consists in reducing the domain shift, i.e., enforcing the data distributions of the two domains to be similar. A popular strategy is to align the marginal distribution in the feature space through adversarial learning. However, this global alignment strategy does not consider the local category-level feature distribution. A possible consequence of the global movement is that some categories which are originally well aligned between the source and target may be incorrectly mapped. To address this problem, this paper introduces a category-level adversarial network, aiming to enforce local semantic consistency during the trend of global alignment. Our idea is to take a close look at the category-level data distribution and align each class with an adaptive adversarial loss. Specifically, we reduce the weight of the adversarial loss for category-level aligned features while increasing the adversarial force for those poorly aligned. In this process, we decide how well a feature is category-level aligned between source and target by a co-training approach. In two domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, we validate that the proposed method matches the state of the art in segmentation accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Taking,a,Closer,Look,at,Domain,Shift:,Category-Level,Adversaries,for,Semantics,Consistent,Domain,Adaptation"
253,ADVENT: Adversarial Entropy Minimization for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a key problem for many computer vision tasks. While approaches based on convolutional neural networks constantly break new records on different benchmarks, generalizing well to diverse testing environments remains a major challenge. In numerous real-world applications, there is indeed a large gap between data distributions in train and test domains, which results in severe performance loss at run-time. In this work, we address the task of unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation with losses based on the entropy of the pixel-wise predictions. To this end, we propose two novel, complementary methods using (i) entropy loss and (ii) adversarial loss respectively. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation on two challenging ""synthetic-2-real"" set-ups and show that the approach can also be used for detection.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ADVENT:,Adversarial,Entropy,Minimization,for,Domain,Adaptation,in,Semantic,Segmentation"

In this paper, we go beyond the local detail representation by introducing context awareness to augment off-the-shelf local feature descriptors. Specifically, we propose a unified learning framework that leverages and aggregates the cross-modality contextual information, including (i) visual context from high-level image representation, and (ii) geometric context from 2D keypoint distribution. Moreover, we propose an effective N-pair loss that eschews the empirical hyper-parameter search and improves the convergence. The proposed augmentation scheme is lightweight compared with the raw local feature description, meanwhile improves remarkably on several large-scale benchmarks with diversified scenes, which demonstrates both strong practicality and generalization ability in geometric matching applications.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"ContextDesc:,Local,Descriptor,Augmentation,With,Cross-Modality,Context"
255,Large-Scale Long-Tailed Recognition in an Open World,"Real world data often have a long-tailed and open-ended distribution. A practical recognition system must classify among majority and minority classes, generalize from a few known instances, and acknowledge novelty upon a never seen instance. We define Open Long-Tailed Recognition (OLTR) as learning from such naturally distributed data and optimizing the classification accuracy over a balanced test set which include head, tail, and open classes. OLTR must handle imbalanced classification, few-shot learning, and open-set recognition in one integrated algorithm, whereas existing classification approaches focus only on one aspect and  deliver poorly over the entire class spectrum. The key challenges are how to share visual knowledge between head and tail classes and how to reduce confusion between tail and open classes. We develop an integrated OLTR algorithm that maps an image to a feature space such that visual concepts can easily relate to each other based on a learned metric that respects the closed-world classification while acknowledging the novelty of the open world. Our so-called dynamic meta-embedding combines a direct image feature and an associated memory feature, with the feature norm indicating the familiarity to known classes. On three large-scale OLTR datasets we curate from object-centric ImageNet, scene-centric Places, and face-centric MS1M data, our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. Our code, datasets, and models enable future OLTR research and are publicly available at https://liuziwei7.github.io/projects/LongTail.html.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Large-Scale,Long-Tailed,Recognition,in,an,Open,World"
256,AET vs. AED: Unsupervised Representation Learning by Auto-Encoding Transformations Rather Than Data,"The success of deep neural networks often relies on a large amount of labeled examples, which can be difficult to obtain in many real scenarios. To address this challenge, unsupervised methods are strongly preferred for training neural networks without using any labeled data. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm of unsupervised representation learning by Auto-Encoding Transformation (AET) in contrast to the conventional Auto-Encoding Data (AED) approach. Given a randomly sampled transformation, AET seeks to predict it merely from the encoded features as accurately as possible at the output end. The idea is the following: as long as the unsupervised features successfully encode the essential information about the visual structures of original and transformed images, the transformation can be well predicted. We will show that this AET paradigm allows us to instantiate a large variety of transformations, from parameterized, to non-parameterized and GAN-induced ones. Our experiments show that AET greatly improves over existing unsupervised approaches, setting new state-of-the-art performances being greatly closer to the upper bounds by their fully supervised counterparts on CIFAR-10, ImageNet and Places datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"AET,vs.,AED:,Unsupervised,Representation,Learning,by,Auto-Encoding,Transformations,Rather,Than,Data"

We present a robust, unified  descriptor network that considers a large context region with high spatial variance. Our network has a very large receptive field and avoids striding layers to maintain spatial resolution. These properties are achieved by creating a novel neural network layer that consists of multiple, parallel, stacked dilated convolutions (SDC). Several of these layers are combined to form our SDC descriptor network. In our experiments, we show that our SDC features outperform state-of-the-art feature descriptors in terms of accuracy and robustness. In addition, we demonstrate the superior performance of SDC in state-of-the-art stereo matching, optical flow and scene flow algorithms on several famous public benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SDC,-,Stacked,Dilated,Convolution:,A,Unified,Descriptor,Network,for,Dense,Matching,Tasks"

The main idea is to use cycle-consistency in time as free supervisory signal for learning visual representations from scratch. At training time, our model learns a feature map representation to be useful for performing cycle-consistent tracking. At test time, we use the acquired representation to find nearest neighbors across space and time. We demonstrate the generalizability of the representation -- without finetuning -- across a range of visual correspondence tasks, including video object segmentation, keypoint tracking, and optical flow. Our approach outperforms previous self-supervised methods and performs competitively with strongly supervised methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Correspondence,From,the,Cycle-Consistency,of,Time"

Differently, in this paper, we focus on unsupervised representation learning and propose a novel framework termed Autoencoder in Autoencoder Networks (AE^2-Nets), which integrates information from heterogeneous sources into an intact representation by the nested autoencoder framework. The proposed method has the following merits: (1) our model jointly performs view-specific representation learning (with the inner autoencoder networks) and multi-view information encoding (with the outer autoencoder networks) in a unified framework; (2) due to the degradation process from the latent representation to each single view, our model flexibly balances the complementarity and consistence among multiple views.

260,Mitigating Information Leakage in Image Representations: A Maximum Entropy Approach,"Image recognition systems have demonstrated tremendous progress over the past few decades thanks, in part, to our ability of learning compact and robust representations of images. As we witness the wide spread adoption of these systems, it is imperative to consider the problem of unintended leakage of information from an image representation, which might compromise the privacy of the data owner. This paper investigates the problem of learning an image representation that minimizes such leakage of user information. We formulate the problem as an adversarial non-zero sum game of finding a good embedding function with two competing goals: to retain as much task dependent discriminative image information as possible, while simultaneously minimizing the amount of information, as measured by entropy, about other sensitive attributes of the user. We analyze the stability and convergence dynamics of the proposed formulation using tools from non-linear systems theory and compare to that of the corresponding adversarial zero-sum game formulation that optimizes likelihood as a measure of information content. Numerical experiments on UCI, Extended Yale B, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets indicate that our proposed approach is able to learn image representations that exhibit high task performance while mitigating leakage of predefined sensitive information.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mitigating,Information,Leakage,in,Image,Representations:,A,Maximum,Entropy,Approach"
261,Learning Spatial Common Sense With Geometry-Aware Recurrent Networks,"We integrate two powerful ideas, geometry and deep visual representation learning, into recurrent network architectures for mobile visual scene understanding. The proposed networks learn to ""lift"" 2D visual features and integrate them over time into latent 3D feature maps of the scene. They are equipped with differentiable geometric operations, such as projection, unprojection, egomotion estimation and stabilization, in order to compute a geometrically-consistent mapping between the world scene and their 3D latent feature space. We train the proposed architectures to predict novel image views given short frame sequences as input. Their predictions strongly generalize to scenes with a novel number of objects, appearances and configurations, and greatly outperform predictions of previous works that do not consider egomotion stabilization or a space-aware latent feature space. We train the proposed architectures to detect and segment objects in 3D, using the latent 3D feature map as input--as opposed to 2D feature maps computed from video frames. The resulting detections are permanent: they continue to exist even when an object gets occluded or leaves the field of view. Our experiments suggest the proposed space-aware latent feature arrangement and egomotion-stabilized convolutions are essential architectural choices for spatial common sense to emerge in artificial embodied visual agents.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Spatial,Common,Sense,With,Geometry-Aware,Recurrent,Networks"
262,Structured Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we investigate the issue of knowledge distillation for training compact semantic segmentation networks by making use of cumbersome networks. We start from the straightforward scheme, pixel-wise distillation, which applies the distillation scheme originally introduced for image classification and performs knowledge distillation for each pixel separately. We further propose to distill the structured knowledge from cumbersome networks into compact networks, which is motivated by the fact that semantic segmentation is a structured prediction  problem. We study two such structured distillation schemes: (i) pair-wise distillation that distills the pairwise similarities, and (ii) holistic distillation that uses adversarial training to distill holistic knowledge. The effectiveness of our knowledge distillation approaches is demonstrated  by extensive experiments on three scene parsing datasets: Cityscapes, Camvid and ADE20K.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Structured,Knowledge,Distillation,for,Semantic,Segmentation"

For a 3D reconstruction of an indoor scene, our method takes as input a set of CAD models, and predicts a 9DoF pose that aligns each model to the underlying scan geometry. To tackle this problem, we create a new scan-to-CAD alignment dataset based on 1506 ScanNet scans with 97607 annotated keypoint pairs between 14225 CAD models from ShapeNet and their counterpart objects in the scans. Our method selects a set of representative keypoints in a 3D scan for which we find correspondences to the CAD geometry. To this end, we design a novel 3D CNN architecture that learns a joint embedding between real and synthetic objects, and from this predicts a correspondence heatmap. Based on these correspondence heatmaps, we formulate a variational energy minimization that aligns a given set of CAD models to the reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on our newly introduced Scan2CAD benchmark where we outperform both handcrafted feature descriptor as well as state-of-the-art CNN based methods by 21.39%.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Scan2CAD:,Learning,CAD,Model,Alignment,in,RGB-D,Scans"

Due to the lack of RGB-depth image pairs, unsupervised learning methods aim at deriving depth information with alternative supervision such as stereo pairs. However, most existing works fail to model the geometric structure of objects, which generally results from considering pixel-level objective functions during training. In this paper, we propose SceneNet to overcome this limitation with the aid of semantic understanding from segmentation. Moreover, our proposed model is able to perform region-aware depth estimation by enforcing semantics consistency between stereo pairs. In our experiments, we qualitatively and quantitatively verify the effectiveness and robustness of our model, which produces favorable results against the state-of-the-art approaches do.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Scene,Understanding:,Unsupervised,Monocular,Depth,Estimation,With,Semantic-Aware,Representation"
265,Tell Me Where I Am: Object-Level Scene Context Prediction,"Contextual information has been shown to be effective in helping solve various image understanding tasks. Previous works have focused on the extraction of contextual information from an image and use it to infer the properties of some object(s) in the image. In this paper, we consider an inverse problem of how to hallucinate missing contextual information from the properties of a few standalone objects. We refer to it as scene context prediction. This problem is difficult as it requires an extensive knowledge of complex and diverse relationships among different objects in natural scenes. We propose a convolutional neural network, which takes as input the properties (i.e., category, shape, and position) of a few standalone objects to predict an object-level scene layout that compactly encodes the semantics and structure of the scene context where the given objects are. Our quantitative experiments and user studies show that our model can generate more plausible scene context than the baseline approach. We demonstrate that our model allows for the synthesis of realistic scene images from just partial scene layouts and internally learns useful features for scene recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Tell,Me,Where,I,Am:,Object-Level,Scene,Context,Prediction"
266,Normalized Object Coordinate Space for Category-Level 6D Object Pose and Size Estimation,"The goal of this paper is to estimate the 6D pose and dimensions of unseen object instances in an RGB-D image. Contrary to ""instance-level"" 6D pose estimation tasks, our problem assumes that no exact object CAD models are available during either training or testing time. To handle different and unseen object instances in a given category, we introduce a Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS)---a shared canonical representation for all possible object instances within a category. Our region-based neural network is then trained to directly infer the correspondence from observed pixels to this shared object representation (NOCS) along with other object information such as class label and instance mask. These predictions can be combined with the depth map to jointly estimate the metric 6D pose and dimensions of multiple objects in a cluttered scene. To train our network, we present a new context-aware technique to generate large amounts of fully annotated mixed reality data. To further improve our model and evaluate its performance on real data, we also provide a fully annotated real-world dataset with large environment and instance variation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to robustly estimate the pose and size of unseen object instances in real environments while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard 6D pose estimation benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Normalized,Object,Coordinate,Space,for,Category-Level,6D,Object,Pose,and,Size,Estimation"

As such, it enables many downstream applications in 3D data processing. For a long time, RANSAC-based methods have been the gold standard for such primitive fitting problems, but they require careful per-input parameter tuning and thus do not scale well for large datasets with diverse shapes. In this work, we introduce Supervised Primitive Fitting Network (SPFN), an end-to-end neural network that can robustly detect a varying number of primitives at different scales without any user control. The network is supervised using ground truth primitive surfaces and primitive membership for the input points. Instead of directly predicting the primitives, our architecture first predicts per-point properties and then uses a differential model estimation module to compute the primitive type and parameters. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of ANSI 3D mechanical component models and demonstrate a significant improvement over both the state-of-the-art RANSAC-based methods and the direct neural prediction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Supervised,Fitting,of,Geometric,Primitives,to,3D,Point,Clouds"
268,Do Better ImageNet Models Transfer Better?,"Transfer learning is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet little work has been done to evaluate the relationship between architecture and transfer. An implicit hypothesis in modern computer vision research is that models that perform better on ImageNet necessarily perform better on other vision tasks. However, this hypothesis has never been systematically tested. Here, we compare the performance of 16 classification networks on 12 image classification datasets. We find that, when networks are used as fixed feature extractors or fine-tuned, there is a strong correlation between ImageNet accuracy and transfer accuracy (r = 0.99 and 0.96, respectively). In the former setting, we find that this relationship is very sensitive to the way in which networks are trained on ImageNet; many common forms of regularization slightly improve ImageNet accuracy but yield features that are much worse for transfer learning. Additionally, we find that, on two small fine-grained image classification datasets, pretraining on ImageNet provides minimal benefits, indicating the learned features from ImageNet do not transfer well to fine-grained tasks. Together, our results show that ImageNet architectures generalize well across datasets, but ImageNet features are less general than previously suggested.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Do,Better,ImageNet,Models,Transfer,Better?"

We propose that advantages may be derived by combining them, in the form of different insights that lead to a novel design and complementary properties that result in better performance. At the feature level, inspired by insights from semi-supervised learning, we propose a classification-aware domain adversarial neural network that brings target examples into more classifiable regions of source domain. Next, we posit that computer vision insights are more amenable to injection at the pixel level. In particular, we use 3D geometry and image synthesis based on a generalized appearance flow to preserve identity across pose transformations, while using an attribute-conditioned CycleGAN to translate a single source into multiple target images that differ in lower-level properties such as lighting.

270,Understanding the Disharmony Between Dropout and Batch Normalization by Variance Shift,"This paper first answers the question ""why do the two most powerful techniques Dropout and Batch Normalization (BN) often lead to a worse performance when they are combined together in many modern neural networks, but cooperate well sometimes as in Wide ResNet (WRN)?"" in both theoretical and empirical aspects. Theoretically, we find that Dropout shifts the variance of a specific neural unit when we transfer the state of that network from training to test. However, BN maintains its statistical variance, which is accumulated from the entire learning procedure, in the test phase. The inconsistency of  variances in Dropout and BN (we name this scheme ""variance shift"") causes the unstable numerical behavior in inference that leads to erroneous predictions finally. Meanwhile, the large feature dimension in WRN further reduces the ""variance shift"" to bring benefits to the overall performance. Thorough experiments on representative modern convolutional networks like DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and Wide ResNet confirm our findings. According to the uncovered mechanism, we get better understandings in the combination of these two techniques and summarize guidelines for better practices.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Understanding,the,Disharmony,Between,Dropout,and,Batch,Normalization,by,Variance,Shift"

Practical applications of deep learning in resource-limited hardware, such as embedded devices and smart phones, however, remain challenging. For binary convolutional networks, the reason lies in the degraded representation caused by binarizing full-precision filters. To address this problem, we propose new circulant filters (CiFs) and a circulant binary convolution (CBConv) to enhance the capacity of binarized convolutional features via our circulant back propagation (CBP). The CiFs can be easily incorporated into existing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which leads to new Circulant Binary Convolutional Networks (CBCNs). Extensive experiments confirm that the performance gap between the 1-bit and full-precision DCNNs is minimized by increasing the filter diversity, which further increases the representational ability in our networks. Our experiments on ImageNet show that CBCNs achieve 61.4% top-1 accuracy with ResNet18. Compared to the state-of-the-art such as XNOR, CBCNs can achieve up to 10% higher top-1 accuracy with more powerful representational ability.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Circulant,Binary,Convolutional,Networks:,Enhancing,the,Performance,of,1-Bit,DCNNs,With,Circulant,Back,Propagation"
272,DeFusionNET: Defocus Blur Detection via Recurrently Fusing and Refining Multi-Scale Deep Features,"Defocus blur detection aims to detect out-of-focus regions from an image. Although attracting more and more attention due to its widespread applications, defocus blur detection still confronts several challenges such as the interference of background clutter, sensitivity to scales and missing boundary details of defocus blur regions. To deal with these issues, we propose a deep neural network which recurrently fuses and refines multi-scale deep features (DeFusionNet) for defocus blur detection. We firstly utilize a fully convolutional network to extract multi-scale deep features. The features from bottom layers are able to capture rich low-level features for details preservation, while the features from top layers can characterize the semantic information to locate blur regions. These features from different layers are fused as shallow features and semantic features, respectively. After that, the fused shallow features are propagated to top layers for refining the fine details of detected defocus blur regions, and the fused semantic features are propagated to bottom layers to assist in better locating the defocus regions. The feature fusing and refining are carried out in a recurrent manner. Also, we finally fuse the output of each layer at the last recurrent step to obtain the final defocus blur map by considering the sensitivity to scales of the defocus degree. Experiments on two commonly used defocus blur detection benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superority of DeFusionNet when compared with other 10 competitors.

273,Deep Virtual Networks for Memory Efficient Inference of Multiple Tasks,"Deep networks consume a large amount of memory by their nature. A natural question arises can we reduce that memory requirement whilst maintaining performance. In particular, in this work we address the problem of memory efficient learning for multiple tasks. To this end, we propose a novel network architecture producing multiple networks of different configurations, termed deep virtual networks (DVNs), for different tasks. Each DVN is specialized for a single task and structured hierarchically. The hierarchical structure, which contains multiple levels of hierarchy corresponding to different numbers of parameters, enables multiple inference for different memory budgets. The building block of a deep virtual network is based on a disjoint collection of parameters of a network, which we call a unit. The lowest level of hierarchy in a deep virtual network is a unit, and higher levels of hierarchy contain lower levels' units and other additional units. Given a budget on the number of parameters, a different level of a deep virtual network can be chosen to perform the task. A unit can be shared by different DVNs, allowing multiple DVNs in a single network. In addition, shared units provide assistance to the target task with additional knowledge learned from another tasks. This cooperative configuration of DVNs makes it possible to handle different tasks in a memory-aware manner. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches for multiple tasks. Notably, ours is more efficient than others as it allows memory-aware inference for all tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Virtual,Networks,for,Memory,Efficient,Inference,of,Multiple,Tasks"
274,Universal Domain Adaptation,"Domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge in the presence of the domain gap. Existing domain adaptation methods rely on rich prior knowledge about the relationship between the label sets of source and target domains, which greatly limits their application in the wild. This paper introduces Universal Domain Adaptation (UDA) that requires no prior knowledge on the label sets. For a given source label set and a target label set, they may contain a common label set and hold a private label set respectively, bringing up an additional category gap. UDA requires a model to either (1) classify the target sample correctly if it is associated with a label in the common label set, or (2) mark it as ""unknown"" otherwise. More importantly, a UDA model should work stably against a wide spectrum of commonness (the proportion of the common label set over the complete label set) so that it can handle real-world problems with unknown target label sets. To solve the universal domain adaptation problem, we propose Universal Adaptation Network (UAN). It quantifies sample-level transferability to discover the common label set and the label sets private to each domain, thereby promoting the adaptation in the automatically discovered common label set and recognizing the ""unknown"" samples successfully.

However, most of the existing adversarial attacks only achieve relatively low success rates under the challenging black-box setting, where the attackers have no knowledge of the model structure and parameters. To this end, we propose to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by creating diverse input patterns. Instead of only using the original images to generate adversarial examples, our method applies random transformations to the input images at each iteration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that the proposed attack method can generate adversarial examples that transfer much better to different networks than existing baselines. By evaluating our method against top defense solutions and official baselines from NIPS 2017 adversarial competition, the enhanced attack reaches an average success rate of 73.0%, which outperforms the top-1 attack submission in the NIPS competition by a large margin of 6.6%. We hope that our proposed attack strategy can serve as a strong benchmark baseline for evaluating the robustness of networks to adversaries and the effectiveness of different defense methods in the future.

276,Sequence-To-Sequence Domain Adaptation Network for Robust Text Image Recognition,"Domain adaptation has shown promising advances for alleviating domain shift problem. However, recent visual domain adaptation works usually focus on non-sequential object recognition with a global coarse alignment, which is inadequate to transfer effective knowledge for sequence-like text images with variable-length fine-grained character information. In this paper, we develop a Sequence-to-Sequence Domain Adaptation Network (SSDAN) for robust text image recognition, which could exploit unsupervised sequence data by an attention-based sequence encoder-decoder network. In the SSDAN,  a gated attention similarity (GAS) unit is introduced to adaptively focus on aligning the distribution of the source and target sequence data in an attended character-level feature space rather than a global coarse alignment. Extensive text recognition experiments show the SSDAN could efficiently transfer sequence knowledge and validate the promising power of the proposed model towards real world applications in various recognition scenarios, including the natural scene text, handwritten text and even mathematical expression recognition.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Sequence-To-Sequence,Domain,Adaptation,Network,for,Robust,Text,Image,Recognition"
277,Hybrid-Attention Based Decoupled Metric Learning for Zero-Shot Image Retrieval,"In zero-shot image retrieval (ZSIR) task, embedding learning becomes more attractive, however, many methods follow the traditional metric learning idea and omit the problems behind zero-shot settings. In this paper, we first emphasize the importance of learning visual discriminative metric and preventing the partial/selective learning behavior of learner in ZSIR, and then propose the Decoupled Metric Learning (DeML) framework to achieve these individually. Instead of coarsely optimizing an unified metric, we decouple it into multiple attention-specific parts so as to recurrently induce the discrimination and explicitly enhance the generalization. And they are mainly achieved by our object-attention module based on random walk graph propagation and the channel-attention module based on the adversary constraint, respectively. We demonstrate the necessity of addressing the vital problems in ZSIR on the popular benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

278,Learning to Sample,"Processing large point clouds is a challenging task. Therefore, the data is often sampled to a size that can be processed more easily. The question is how to sample the data? A popular sampling technique is Farthest Point Sampling (FPS). However, FPS is agnostic to a downstream application (classification, retrieval, etc.). The underlying assumption seems to be that minimizing the farthest point distance, as done by FPS, is a good proxy to other objective functions.  We show that it is better to learn how to sample. To do that, we propose a deep network to simplify 3D point clouds. The network, termed S-NET, takes a point cloud and produces a smaller point cloud that is optimized for a particular task. The simplified point cloud is not guaranteed to be a subset of the original point cloud. Therefore, we match it to a subset of the original points in a post-processing step. We contrast our approach with FPS by experimenting on two standard data sets and show significantly better results for a variety of applications.

279,Few-Shot Learning via Saliency-Guided Hallucination of Samples,"Learning new concepts from a few of  samples is a standard challenge in computer vision. The main directions to improve the learning ability of few-shot training models include (i) a robust similarity learning and (ii) generating or hallucinating additional data from the limited existing samples. In this paper, we follow the latter direction and present a novel data hallucination model. Currently, most datapoint generators contain a specialized network (i.e., GAN) tasked with hallucinating new datapoints, thus requiring large numbers of annotated data for their training in the first place. In this paper, we propose a novel less-costly hallucination method for few-shot learning which utilizes saliency maps. To this end, we employ a saliency network to obtain the foregrounds and backgrounds of available image samples and feed the resulting maps into a two-stream network to hallucinate datapoints directly in the feature space from viable foreground-background combinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage saliency maps for such a task and we demonstrate their usefulness in hallucinating additional datapoints for few-shot learning.

280,Variational Convolutional Neural Network Pruning,"We propose a variational Bayesian scheme for pruning convolutional neural networks in channel level. This idea is motivated by the fact that deterministic value based pruning methods are inherently improper and unstable.  In a nutshell, variational technique is introduced to estimate distribution of a newly proposed  parameter, called channel saliency, based on this, redundant channels can be  removed from model via a simple criterion. The advantages are two-fold: 1) Our method conducts channel pruning without desire of re-training stage, thus improving the computation efficiency.  2) Our method is implemented as a stand-alone module, called variational pruning layer, which can be straightforwardly inserted into off-the-shelf deep learning packages, without any special network  design. Extensive experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method: For CIFAR-10, we perform  channel removal on different CNN models up to 74% reduction, which results in significant size reduction and computation saving. For ImageNet, about 40% channels of ResNet-50 are removed  without compromising accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Variational,Convolutional,Neural,Network,Pruning"
281,Towards Optimal Structured CNN Pruning via Generative Adversarial Learning,"Structured pruning of filters or neurons has received increased focus for compressing convolutional neural networks. Most existing methods rely on multi-stage optimizations in a layer-wise manner for iteratively pruning and retraining which may not be optimal and may be computation intensive. Besides, these methods are designed for pruning a specific structure, such as filter or block structures without jointly pruning heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we propose an effective structured pruning approach that jointly prunes filters as well as other structures in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish this, we first introduce a soft mask to scale the output of these structures by defining a new objective function with sparsity regularization to align the output of baseline and network with this mask. We then effectively solve the optimization problem by generative adversarial learning (GAL), which learns a sparse soft mask in a label-free and an end-to-end manner. By forcing more scale factors in the soft mask to zero, the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) can be leveraged to fast and reliably remove the corresponding structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GAL on different datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012. For example, on ImageNet ILSVRC 2012, the pruned ResNet-50 achieves 10.88% Top-5 error and results in a factor of 3.7x speedup. This significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Optimal,Structured,CNN,Pruning,via,Generative,Adversarial,Learning"
282,Exploiting Kernel Sparsity and Entropy for Interpretable CNN Compression,"Compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has received ever-increasing research focus. However, most existing CNN compression methods do not interpret their inherent structures to distinguish the implicit redundancy. In this paper, we investigate the problem of CNN compression from a novel interpretable perspective. The relationship between the input feature maps and 2D kernels is revealed in a theoretical framework, based on which a kernel sparsity and entropy (KSE) indicator is proposed to quantitate the feature map importance in a feature-agnostic manner to guide model compression. Kernel clustering is further conducted based on the KSE indicator to accomplish high-precision CNN compression. KSE is capable of simultaneously compressing each layer in an efficient way, which is significantly faster compared to previous data-driven feature map pruning methods. We comprehensively evaluate the compression and speedup of the proposed method on CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet 2012. Our method demonstrates superior performance gains over previous ones. In particular, it achieves 4.7x FLOPs reduction and 2.9x compression on ResNet-50 with only a top-5 accuracy drop of 0.35% on ImageNet 2012, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Exploiting,Kernel,Sparsity,and,Entropy,for,Interpretable,CNN,Compression"
283,Fully Quantized Network for Object Detection,"Efficient neural network inference is important in a number of practical domains, such as deployment in mobile settings.  An effective method for increasing inference efficiency is to use low bitwidth arithmetic, which can subsequently be accelerated using dedicated hardware.  However, designing effective quantization schemes while maintaining network accuracy is challenging.  In particular, current techniques face difficulty in performing fully end-to-end quantization, making use of aggressively low bitwidth regimes such as 4-bit, and applying quantized networks to complex tasks such as object detection.  In this paper, we demonstrate that many of these difficulties arise because of instability during the fine-tuning stage of the quantization process, and propose several novel techniques to overcome these instabilities. We apply our techniques to produce fully quantized 4-bit detectors based on RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN, and show that these achieve state-of-the-art performance for quantized detectors. The mAP loss due to quantization using our methods is more than 3.8x less than the loss from existing methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fully,Quantized,Network,for,Object,Detection"
284,MnasNet: Platform-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Mobile,"Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture search (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNet achieves 75.2% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8x faster than MobileNetV2 with 0.5% higher accuracy and 2.3x faster than NASNet with 1.2% higher accuracy.

To this end, we propose an innovative training strategy that learns the parameters of the student intertwined with the teachers, achieved by ""projecting""  its amalgamated features onto each teacher's domain and computing the loss.  We also introduce two options to generalize the proposed training strategy to handle three or more tasks simultaneously. The proposed scheme yields very encouraging results.

In this work, we revisit the sign() function from the perspective of space partitioning. In specific, we bridge the gap between k-nearest neighbors and binary hashing codes with Shannon entropy. We further propose a novel K-Nearest Neighbors Hashing (KNNH) method to learn binary representations from KNN within the subspaces generated by sign(). Theoretical and experimental results show that the KNN relation is of central importance to neighbor preserving embeddings, and the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"K-Nearest,Neighbors,Hashing"
287,Learning RoI Transformer for Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images,"Object detection in aerial images is an active yet challenging task in computer vision because of the bird's-eye view perspective, the highly complex backgrounds, and the variant appearances of objects. Especially when detecting densely packed objects in aerial images, methods relying on horizontal proposals for common object detection often introduce mismatches between the Region of Interests (RoIs) and objects. This leads to the common misalignment between the final object classification confidence and localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a RoI Transformer to address these problems. The core idea of RoI Transformer is to apply spatial transformations on RoIs and learn the transformation parameters under the supervision of oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations. RoI Transformer is with lightweight and can be easily embedded into detectors for oriented object detection. Simply apply the RoI Transformer to light head RCNN has achieved state-of-the-art performances on two common and challenging aerial datasets, i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016, with a neglectable reduction to detection speed. Our RoI Transformer exceeds the deformable Position Sensitive RoI pooling when oriented bounding-box annotations are available.

288,Snapshot Distillation: Teacher-Student Optimization in One Generation,"Optimizing a deep neural network is a fundamental task in computer vision, yet direct training methods often suffer from over-fitting. Teacher-student optimization aims at providing complementary cues from a model trained previously, but these approaches are often considerably slow due to the pipeline of training a few generations in sequence, i.e., time complexity is increased by several times.  This paper presents snapshot distillation (SD), the first framework which enables teacher-student optimization in one generation. The idea of SD is very simple: instead of borrowing supervision signals from previous generations, we extract such information from earlier epochs in the same generation, meanwhile make sure that the difference between teacher and student is sufficiently large so as to prevent under-fitting. To achieve this goal, we implement SD in a cyclic learning rate policy, in which the last snapshot of each cycle is used as the teacher for all iterations in the next cycle, and the teacher signal is smoothed to provide richer information. In standard image classification benchmarks such as CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012, SD achieves consistent accuracy gain without heavy computational overheads. We also verify that models pre-trained with SD transfers well to object detection and semantic segmentation in the PascalVOC dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Snapshot,Distillation:,Teacher-Student,Optimization,in,One,Generation"

However, most existing approaches require accurate depth map as input to segment the scene which severely limits their applications. In this paper, we propose to jointly infer the semantic and depth information by distilling geometry-aware embedding to eliminate such strong constraint while still exploiting the helpful depth domain information. In addition, we use this learned embedding to improve the quality of semantic segmentation, through a proposed geometry-aware propagation framework followed by several multi-level skip feature fusion blocks. By decoupling the single task prediction network into two joint tasks of semantic segmentation and geometry embedding learning, together with the proposed information propagation and feature fusion architecture, our method is shown to perform favorably against state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation on publicly available challenging indoor datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Geometry-Aware,Distillation,for,Indoor,Semantic,Segmentation"

Our technical contributions are: a triplet convnet architecture that incorporates an RNN based variational autoencoder to search for images using vector (stroke-based) queries; real-time clustering to identify likely search intents (and so, targets within the search embedding); and the use of backpropagation from those targets to perturb the input stroke sequence, so suggesting alterations to the query in order to guide the search.

However, we observe that ambiguities are still introduced when labeling the bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose a novel bounding box regression loss for learning bounding box transformation and localization variance together. Our loss greatly improves the localization accuracies of various architectures with nearly no additional computation. The learned localization variance allows us to merge neighboring bounding boxes during non-maximum suppression (NMS), which further improves the localization performance. On MS-COCO, we boost the Average Precision (AP) of VGG-16 Faster R-CNN from 23.6% to 29.1%. More importantly, for ResNet-50-FPN Mask R-CNN, our method improves the AP and AP90 by 1.8% and 6.2% respectively, which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art bounding box refinement methods.

Our solution is based on learning latent representations of in-class examples using a de-noising auto-encoder network. The key contribution of our work is our proposal to explicitly constrain the latent space to exclusively represent the given class. In order to accomplish this goal, firstly, we force the latent space to have bounded support by introducing a tanh activation in the encoder's output layer. Secondly, using a discriminator in the latent space that is trained adversarially, we ensure that encoded representations of in-class examples resemble uniform random samples drawn from the same bounded space. Thirdly, using a second adversarial discriminator in the input space, we ensure all randomly drawn latent samples generate examples that look real. Finally, we introduce a gradient-descent based sampling technique that explores points in the latent space that generate potential out-of-class examples, which are fed back to the network to further train it to generate in-class examples from those points. The effectiveness of the proposed method is measured across four publicly available datasets using two one-class novelty detection protocols where we achieve state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"OCGAN:,One-Class,Novelty,Detection,Using,GANs,With,Constrained,Latent,Representations"

Network distillation has been successfully applied to improve image classification, but has hardly been explored for metric learning. To do so, we propose two new loss functions that model the communication of a deep teacher network to a small student network. We evaluate our system in several datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products and show that embeddings computed using small student networks perform significantly better than those computed using standard networks of similar size. Results on a very compact network (MobileNet-0.25), which can be used on mobile devices, show that the proposed method can greatly improve Recall@1 results from 27.5% to 44.6%.

In our work, we try to leverage not only the object class labels but also the action labels associated with the data. We show that the action depicted in the image/video can provide strong cues about the location of the associated object. We learn a spatial prior for the object dependent on the action (e.g. ""ball"" is closer to ""leg of the person"" in ""kicking ball""), and incorporate this prior to simultaneously train a joint object detection and action classification model. We conducted experiments on both video datasets and image datasets to evaluate the performance of our weakly supervised object detection model.

295,Separate to Adapt: Open Set Domain Adaptation via Progressive Separation,"Domain adaptation has become a resounding success in leveraging labeled data from a source domain to learn an accurate classifier for an unlabeled target domain. When deployed in the wild, the target domain usually contains unknown classes that are not observed in the source domain. Such setting is termed Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA). While several methods have been proposed to address OSDA, none of them takes into account the openness of the target domain, which is measured by the proportion of unknown classes in all target classes. Openness is a critical point in open set domain adaptation and exerts a significant impact on performance. In addition, current work aligns the entire target domain with the source domain without excluding unknown samples, which may give rise to negative transfer due to the mismatch between unknown and known classes. To this end, this paper presents Separate to Adapt (STA), an end-to-end approach to open set domain adaptation. The approach adopts a coarse-to-fine weighting mechanism to progressively separate the samples of unknown and known classes, and simultaneously weigh their importance on feature distribution alignment. Our approach allows openness-robust open set domain adaptation, which can be adaptive to a variety of openness in the target domain. We evaluate STA on several benchmark datasets of various openness levels. Results verify that STA significantly outperforms previous methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Separate,to,Adapt:,Open,Set,Domain,Adaptation,via,Progressive,Separation"
296,Layout-Graph Reasoning for Fashion Landmark Detection,"Detecting dense landmarks for diverse clothes, as a fundamental technique for clothes analysis, has attracted increasing research attention due to its huge application potential. However, due to the lack of modeling underlying semantic layout constraints among landmarks, prior works often detect ambiguous and structure-inconsistent landmarks of multiple overlapped clothes in one person. In this paper, we propose to seamlessly enforce structural layout relationships among landmarks on the intermediate representations via multiple stacked layout-graph reasoning layers. We define the layout-graph as a hierarchical structure including a root node, body-part nodes (e.g. upper body, lower body), coarse clothes-part nodes (e.g. collar, sleeve) and leaf landmark nodes (e.g. left-collar, right-collar). Each Layout-Graph Reasoning(LGR) layer aims to map feature representations into structural graph nodes via a Map-to-Node module, performs reasoning over structural graph nodes to achieve global layout coherency via a layout-graph reasoning module, and then maps graph nodes back to enhance feature representations via a Node-to-Map module. The layout-graph reasoning module integrates a graph clustering operation to generate representations of intermediate nodes (bottom-up inference) and then a graph deconvolution operation (top-down inference) over the whole graph. Extensive experiments on two public fashion landmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model. Furthermore, to advance the fine-grained fashion landmark research for supporting more comprehensive clothes generation and attribute recognition, we contribute the first Fine-grained Fashion Landmark Dataset (FFLD) containing 200k images annotated with at most 32 key-points for 13 clothes types.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Layout-Graph,Reasoning,for,Fashion,Landmark,Detection"

Particularly, deep hashing methods have greatly improved the search performance, typically under supervised scenarios.  In contrast, unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of supervisory similarity signals. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a new deep unsupervised hashing model, called DistilHash, which can learn a distilled data set, where data pairs have confident similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the initial but noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by the optimal Bayesian classifier. We show that, under a mild assumption, some data pairs, of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the optimal Bayesian classifier, can be potentially distilled. With this understanding, we design a simple but effective method to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hashing functions from the distilled data set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art search performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DistillHash:,Unsupervised,Deep,Hashing,by,Distilling,Data,Pairs"
298,Mind Your Neighbours: Image Annotation With Metadata Neighbourhood Graph Co-Attention Networks,"As the visual reflections of our daily lives, images are frequently shared on the social network, which generates the abundant 'metadata' that records user interactions with images. Due to the diverse contents and complex styles, some images can be challenging to recognise when neglecting the context. Images with the similar metadata, such as 'relevant topics and textual descriptions', 'common friends of users' and 'nearby locations', form a neighbourhood for each image, which can be used to assist the annotation. In this paper, we propose a Metadata Neighbourhood Graph Co-Attention Network (MangoNet) to model the correlations between each target image and its neighbours. To accurately capture the visual clues from the neighbourhood, a co-attention mechanism is introduced to embed the target image and its neighbours as graph nodes, while the graph edges capture the node pair correlations. By reasoning on the neighbourhood graph, we obtain the graph representation to help annotate the target image. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed model achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mind,Your,Neighbours:,Image,Annotation,With,Metadata,Neighbourhood,Graph,Co-Attention,Networks"

State-of-the-art detectors mostly rely on a dense anchoring scheme, where anchors are sampled uniformly over the spatial domain with a predefined set of scales and aspect ratios. In this paper, we revisit this foundational stage. Our study shows that it can be done much more effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we present an alternative scheme, named Guided Anchoring, which leverages semantic features to guide the anchoring. The proposed method jointly predicts the locations where the center of objects of interest are likely to exist as well as the scales and aspect ratios at different locations. On top of predicted anchor shapes, we mitigate the feature inconsistency with a feature adaption module. We also study the use of high-quality proposals to improve detection performance. The anchoring scheme can be seamlessly integrated into proposal methods and detectors. With Guided Anchoring, we achieve 9.1% higher recall on MS COCO with 90% fewer anchors than the RPN baseline. We also adopt Guided Anchoring in Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet, respectively improving the detection mAP by 2.2%, 2.7% and 1.2%.

300,Distant Supervised Centroid Shift: A Simple and Efficient Approach to Visual Domain Adaptation,"Conventional domain adaptation methods usually resort to deep neural networks or subspace learning to find invariant representations across domains. However, most deep learning methods highly rely on large-size source domains and are computationally expensive to train, while subspace learning methods always have a quadratic time complexity that suffers from the large domain size. This paper provides a simple and efficient solution, which could be regarded as a well-performing baseline for domain adaptation tasks.          Our method is built upon the nearest centroid classifier, seeking a subspace where the centroids in the target domain are moderately shifted from those in the source domain. Specifically, we design a unified objective without accessing the source domain data and adopt an alternating minimization scheme to iteratively discover the pseudo target labels, invariant subspace, and target centroids. Besides its privacy-preserving property (distant supervision), the algorithm is provably convergent and has a promising linear time complexity. In addition, the proposed method can be readily extended to multi-source setting and domain generalization, and it remarkably enhances popular deep adaptation methods by borrowing the learned transferable features. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks including object, digit, and face recognition datasets validate that our methods yield state-of-the-art results in various domain adaptation tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Distant,Supervised,Centroid,Shift:,A,Simple,and,Efficient,Approach,to,Visual,Domain,Adaptation"
301,Learning to Transfer Examples for Partial Domain Adaptation,"Domain adaptation is critical for learning in new and unseen environments. With domain adversarial training, deep networks can learn disentangled and transferable features that effectively diminish the dataset shift between the source and target domains for knowledge transfer. In the era of Big Data, large-scale labeled datasets are readily available, stimulating the interest in partial domain adaptation (PDA), which transfers a recognizer from a large labeled domain to a small unlabeled domain. It extends standard domain adaptation to the scenario where target labels are only a subset of source labels.  Under the condition that target labels are unknown, the key challenges of PDA are how to transfer relevant examples in the shared classes to promote positive transfer and how to ignore irrelevant ones in the source domain to mitigate negative transfer. In this work, we propose a unified approach to PDA, Example Transfer Network (ETN), which jointly learns domain-invariant representations across domains and a progressive weighting scheme to quantify the transferability of source examples. A thorough evaluation on several benchmark datasets shows that ETN consistently achieves state-of-the-art results for various partial domain adaptation tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Transfer,Examples,for,Partial,Domain,Adaptation"
302,Generalized Zero-Shot Recognition Based on Visually Semantic Embedding,"We propose a novel Generalized Zero-Shot learning (GZSL) method that is agnostic to both unseen images and unseen semantic vectors during training. Prior works in this context propose to map high-dimensional visual features to the semantic domain, which we believe contributes to the semantic gap. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel low-dimensional embedding of visual instances that is ""visually semantic."" Analogous to semantic data that quantifies the existence of an attribute in the presented instance, components of our visual embedding quantifies existence of a prototypical part-type in the presented instance. In parallel, as a thought experiment, we quantify the impact of noisy semantic data by utilizing a novel visual oracle to visually supervise a learner. These factors, namely semantic noise, visual-semantic gap and label noise lead us to propose a new graphical model for inference with pairwise interactions between label, semantic data, and inputs. We tabulate results on a number of benchmark datasets demonstrating significant improvement in accuracy over state-of-art under both semantic and visual supervision.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Generalized,Zero-Shot,Recognition,Based,on,Visually,Semantic,Embedding"
303,Towards Visual Feature Translation,"Most existing visual search systems are deployed based upon fixed kinds of visual features, which prohibits the feature reusing across different systems or when upgrading systems with a new type of feature. Such a setting is obviously inflexible and time/memory consuming, which is indeed mendable if visual features can be ""translated"" across systems. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards visual feature translation to break through the barrier of using features across different visual search systems. To this end, we propose a Hybrid Auto-Encoder (HAE) to translate visual features, which learns a mapping by minimizing the translation and reconstruction errors. Based upon HAE, an Undirected Affinity Measurement (UAM) is further designed to quantify the affinity among different types of visual features. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several public datasets with sixteen different types of widely-used features in visual search systems. Quantitative results show the encouraging possibilities of feature translation. For the first time, the affinity among widely-used features like SIFT and DELF is reported.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Towards,Visual,Feature,Translation"
304,Amodal Instance Segmentation With KINS Dataset,"Amodal instance segmentation, a new direction of instance segmentation, aims to segment each object instance involving its invisible, occluded parts to imitate human ability. This task requires to reason objects' complex structure. Despite important and futuristic, this task lacks data with large-scale and detailed annotations, due to the difficulty of correctly and consistently labeling invisible parts, which creates the huge barrier to explore the frontier of visual recognition. In this paper, we augment KITTI with more instance pixel-level annotation for 8 categories, which we call KITTI INStance dataset (KINS). We propose the network structure to reason invisible parts via a new multi-task framework with Multi-View Coding (MVC), which combines information in various recognition levels. Extensive experiments show that our MVC effectively improves both amodal and inmodal segmentation. The KINS dataset and our proposed method will be made publicly available.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Amodal,Instance,Segmentation,With,KINS,Dataset"
305,Global Second-Order Pooling Convolutional Networks,"Deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are fundamental to, besides large-scale visual recognition, a lot of vision tasks. As the primary goal of the ConvNets is to characterize complex boundaries of thousands of classes in a high-dimensional space, it is critical to learn higher-order representations for enhancing non-linear modeling capability. Recently, Global Second-order Pooling (GSoP), plugged at the end of networks, has attracted increasing attentions, achieving much better performance than classical, first-order networks in a variety of vision tasks. However, how to effectively introduce higher-order representation in earlier layers for improving non-linear capability of ConvNets is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel network model introducing GSoP across from lower to higher layers for exploiting holistic image information throughout a network. Given an input 3D tensor outputted by some previous convolutional layer, we perform GSoP to obtain a covariance matrix which, after nonlinear transformation, is used for tensor scaling along channel dimension. Similarly, we can perform GSoP along spatial dimension for tensor scaling as well. In this way, we can make full use of the second-order statistics of the holistic image throughout a network. The proposed networks are thoroughly evaluated on large-scale ImageNet-1K, and experiments have shown that they outperform non-trivially the counterparts while achieving state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Global,Second-Order,Pooling,Convolutional,Networks"
306,Weakly Supervised Complementary Parts Models for Fine-Grained Image Classification From the Bottom Up,"Given a training dataset composed of images and corresponding category labels, deep convolutional neural networks show a strong ability in mining discriminative parts for image classification. However, deep convolutional neural networks trained with image level labels only tend to focus on the most discriminative parts while missing other object parts, which could provide complementary information. In this paper, we approach this problem from a different perspective. We build complementary parts models in a weakly supervised manner to retrieve information suppressed by dominant object parts detected by convolutional neural networks. Given image level labels only, we first extract rough object instances by performing weakly supervised object detection and instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN and CRF-based segmentation. Then we estimate and search for the best parts model for each object instance under the principle of preserving as much diversity as possible. In the last stage, we build a bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) network to fuze and encode the partial information of these complementary parts into a comprehensive feature for image classification. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method not only achieves significant improvement over our baseline models, but also outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin (6.7%, 2.8%, 5.2% respectively) on Stanford Dogs 120, Caltech-UCSD Birds 2011-200 and Caltech 256.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Weakly,Supervised,Complementary,Parts,Models,for,Fine-Grained,Image,Classification,From,the,Bottom,Up"
307,"NetTailor: Tuning the Architecture, Not Just the Weights","Real-world applications of object recognition often require the solution of multiple tasks in a single platform. Under the standard paradigm of network fine-tuning, an entirely new CNN is learned per task, and the final network size is independent of task complexity. This is wasteful, since simple tasks require smaller networks than more complex tasks, and limits the number of tasks that can be solved simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose a transfer learning procedure, denoted NetTailor, in which layers of a pre-trained CNN are used as universal blocks that can be combined with small task-specific layers to generate new networks. Besides minimizing classification error, the new network is trained to mimic the internal activations of a strong unconstrained CNN, and minimize its complexity by the combination of 1) a soft-attention mechanism over blocks and 2) complexity regularization constraints. In this way, NetTailor can adapt the network architecture, not just its weights, to the target task. Experiments show that networks adapted to simple tasks, such as character or traffic sign recognition, become significantly smaller than those adapted to hard tasks, such as fine-grained recognition. More importantly, due to the modular nature of the procedure, this reduction in network complexity is achieved without compromise of either parameter sharing across tasks, or classification accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"NetTailor:,Tuning,the,Architecture,,Not,Just,the,Weights"
308,Learning-Based Sampling for Natural Image Matting,"The goal of natural image matting is the estimation of opacities of a user-defined foreground object that is essential in creating realistic composite imagery. Natural matting is a challenging process due to the high number of unknowns in the mathematical modeling of the problem, namely the opacities as well as the foreground and background layer colors, while the original image serves as the single observation. In this paper, we propose the estimation of the layer colors through the use of deep neural networks prior to the opacity estimation. The layer color estimation is a better match for the capabilities of neural networks, and the availability of these colors substantially increase the performance of opacity estimation due to the reduced number of unknowns in the compositing equation. A prominent approach to matting in parallel to ours is called sampling-based matting, which involves gathering color samples from known-opacity regions to predict the layer colors. Our approach outperforms not only the previous hand-crafted sampling algorithms, but also current data-driven methods. We hence classify our method as a hybrid sampling- and learning-based approach to matting, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through detailed ablation studies using alternative network architectures.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning-Based,Sampling,for,Natural,Image,Matting"
309,Learning Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation Through Visual Attention,"This paper conducts a systematic study on the role of visual attention in Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) tasks. By elaborately annotating three popular video segmentation datasets (DAVIS, Youtube-Objects and SegTrack V2) with dynamic eye-tracking data in the UVOS setting, for the first time, we quantitatively verified the high consistency of visual attention behavior among human observers, and found strong correlation between human attention and explicit primary object judgements during dynamic, task-driven viewing. Such novel observations provide an in-depth insight into the underlying rationale behind UVOS. Inspired by these findings, we decouple UVOS into two sub-tasks: UVOS-driven Dynamic Visual Attention Prediction (DVAP) in spatiotemporal domain, and Attention-Guided Object Segmentation (AGOS) in spatial domain. Our UVOS solution enjoys three major merits: 1) modular training without using expensive video segmentation annotations, instead, using more affordable dynamic fixation data to train the initial video attention module and using existing fixation-segmentation paired static/image data to train the subsequent segmentation module; 2) comprehensive foreground understanding through multi-source learning; and 3) additional interpretability from the biologically-inspired and assessable attention. Experiments on popular benchmarks show that, even without using expensive video object mask annotations, our model achieves compelling performance in comparison with state-of-the-arts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Unsupervised,Video,Object,Segmentation,Through,Visual,Attention"
310,4D Spatio-Temporal ConvNets: Minkowski Convolutional Neural Networks,"In many robotics and VR/AR applications, 3D-videos are readily-available input sources (a sequence of depth images, or LIDAR scans). However, in many cases, the 3D-videos are processed frame-by-frame either through 2D convnets or 3D perception algorithms. In this work, we propose 4-dimensional convolutional neural networks for spatio-temporal perception that can directly process such 3D-videos using high-dimensional convolutions. For this, we adopt sparse tensors and propose generalized sparse convolutions that encompass all discrete convolutions. To implement the generalized sparse convolution, we create an open-source auto-differentiation library for sparse tensors that provides extensive functions for high-dimensional convolutional neural networks. We create 4D spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks using the library and validate them on various 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks and proposed 4D datasets for 3D-video perception. To overcome challenges in 4D space, we propose the hybrid kernel, a special case of the generalized sparse convolution, and trilateral-stationary conditional random fields that enforce spatio-temporal consistency in the 7D space-time-chroma space. Experimentally, we show that a convolutional neural network with only generalized 3D sparse convolutions can outperform 2D or 2D-3D hybrid methods by a large margin. Also, we show that on 3D-videos, 4D spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks are robust to noise and outperform the 3D convolutional neural network.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"4D,Spatio-Temporal,ConvNets:,Minkowski,Convolutional,Neural,Networks"
311,Pyramid Feature Attention Network for Saliency Detection,"Saliency detection is one of the basic challenges in computer vision. Recently, CNNs are the most widely used and powerful techniques for saliency detection, in which feature maps from different layers are always integrated without distinction. However, instinctively, the different feature maps of CNNs and the different features in the same maps should play different roles in saliency detection. To address this problem, a novel CNN named pyramid feature attention network (PFAN) is proposed to enhance the high-level context features and the low-level spatial structural features. In the proposed PFAN, a context-aware pyramid feature extraction (CPFE) module is designed for multi-scale high-level feature maps to capture the rich context features. A channel-wise attention (CA) model and a spatial attention (SA) model are respectively applied to the CPFE feature maps and the low-level feature maps, and then fused to detect salient regions. Finally, an edge preservation loss is proposed to get the accurate boundaries of salient regions. The proposed PFAN is extensively evaluated on five benchmark datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under different evaluation metrics.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pyramid,Feature,Attention,Network,for,Saliency,Detection"

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical image co-saliency detection framework as a coarse to fine strategy to capture this pattern. We first propose a mask-guided fully convolutional network structure to generate the initial co-saliency detection result. The mask is used for background removal and it is learned from the high-level feature response maps of the pre-trained VGG-net output. We next propose a multi-scale label smoothing model to further refine the detection result. The proposed model jointly optimizes the label smoothness of pixels and superpixels. Experiment results on three popular image co-saliency detection benchmark datasets including iCoseg, MSRC and Cosal2015 demonstrate the remarkable performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Co-Saliency,Detection,via,Mask-Guided,Fully,Convolutional,Networks,With,Multi-Scale,Label,Smoothing"

Humans can effortlessly recognize partially occluded objects and reliably estimate their spatial extent beyond the visible. However, few modern computer vision techniques are capable of reasoning about occluded parts of an object. This is partly due to the fact that very few image datasets and no video dataset exist which permit development of those methods. To address this issue, we present a synthetic dataset extracted from the photo-realistic game GTA-V. Each frame is accompanied with densely annotated, pixel-accurate visible and amodal segmentation masks with semantic labels. More than 1.8M objects are annotated resulting in 100 times more annotations than existing datasets. We demonstrate the challenges of the dataset by quantifying the performance of several baselines.

314,Learning Instance Activation Maps for Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation,"Discriminative region responses residing inside an object instance can be extracted from networks trained with image-level label supervision. However, learning the full extent of pixel-level instance response in a weakly supervised manner remains unexplored. In this work, we tackle this challenging problem by using a novel instance extent filling approach. We first design a process to selectively collect pseudo supervision from noisy segment proposals obtained with previously published techniques. The pseudo supervision is used to learn a differentiable filling module that predicts a class-agnostic activation map for each instance given the image and an incomplete region response. We refer to the above maps as Instance Activation Maps (IAMs), which provide a fine-grained instance-level representation and allow instance masks to be extracted by lightweight CRF. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC12 dataset show that our approach beats the state-of-the-art weakly supervised instance segmentation methods by a significant margin and increases the inference speed by an order of magnitude. Our method also generalizes well across domains and to unseen object categories. Without fine-tuning for the specific tasks, our model trained on VOC12 dataset (20 classes) obtains top performance for weakly supervised object localization on the CUB dataset (200 classes) and achieves competitive results on three widely used salient object detection benchmarks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Instance,Activation,Maps,for,Weakly,Supervised,Instance,Segmentation"
315,Decoders Matter for Semantic Segmentation: Data-Dependent Decoding Enables Flexible Feature Aggregation,"Recent semantic segmentation methods exploit encoder-decoder architectures to produce the desired pixel-wise segmentation prediction. The last layer of the decoders is typically a bilinear upsampling procedure to recover the final pixel-wise prediction. We empirically show that this oversimple and data-independent bilinear upsampling may lead to sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a data-dependent upsampling (DUpsampling) to replace bilinear, which takes advantages of the redundancy in the label space of semantic segmentation and is able to recover the pixel-wise prediction from low-resolution outputs of CNNs.  The main advantage of the new upsampling layer lies in that with a relatively lower-resolution feature map such as 1/16 or 1/32 of the input size, we can achieve even better segmentation accuracy, significantly reducing computation complexity. This is made possible by 1) the new upsampling layer's much improved reconstruction capability; and more importantly 2) the DUpsampling based decoder's flexibility in leveraging almost arbitrary combinations of the CNN encoders' features. Experiments on PASCAL VOC demonstrate that with much less computation complexity, our decoder outperforms the state-of-the-art decoder. Finally, without any post-processing, the framework equipped with our proposed decoder achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two datasets: 88.1% mIOU on PASCAL VOC with 30% computation of the previously best model; and 52.5% mIOU on PASCAL Context.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Decoders,Matter,for,Semantic,Segmentation:,Data-Dependent,Decoding,Enables,Flexible,Feature,Aggregation"
316,Box-Driven Class-Wise Region Masking and Filling Rate Guided Loss for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has achieved huge progress via adopting deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). However, the performance of FCN based models severely rely on the amounts of pixel-level annotations which are expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, it is a good choice to learn to segment with weak supervision from bounding boxes. How to make full use of the class-level and region-level supervisions from bounding boxes is the critical challenge for the weakly supervised learning task. In this paper, we first introduce a box-driven class-wise masking model (BCM) to remove irrelevant regions of each class. Moreover, based on the pixel-level segment proposal generated from the bounding box supervision, we could calculate the mean filling rates of each class to serve as an important prior cue, then we propose a filling rate guided adaptive loss (FR-Loss) to help the model ignore the wrongly labeled pixels in proposals. Unlike previous methods directly training models with the fixed individual segment proposals, our method can adjust the model learning with global statistical information. Thus it can help reduce the negative impacts from wrongly labeled proposals. We evaluate the proposed method on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and compare with other methods. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and achieves the state-of-the-art results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Box-Driven,Class-Wise,Region,Masking,and,Filling,Rate,Guided,Loss,for,Weakly,Supervised,Semantic,Segmentation"
317,Dual Attention Network for Scene Segmentation,"In this paper, we address the scene segmentation task by  capturing rich contextual  dependencies based on the self-attention  mechanism. Unlike previous works that capture contexts by multi-scale features fusion, we propose a Dual Attention Networks (DANet) to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on top of traditional dilated FCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. The position attention module selectively aggregates the features at each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions. Similar features would be related to each other regardless of their distances.  Meanwhile, the channel attention module selectively emphasizes interdependent channel maps by integrating associated features among all channel maps. We sum the outputs of the two attention modules to further improve feature representation which contributes to more precise segmentation results. We achieve new state-of-the-art segmentation performance on three challenging scene segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff dataset. In particular, a Mean IoU score of 81.5% on Cityscapes test set is achieved without using coarse data.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dual,Attention,Network,for,Scene,Segmentation"

Since the problem is ill-posed we introduce additional supervision: 1. We learn a statistical natural illumination prior, 2. Our key insight is to perform offline multiview stereo (MVS) on images containing rich illumination variation. From the MVS pose and depth maps, we can cross project between overlapping views such that Siamese training can be used to ensure consistent estimation of photometric invariants. MVS depth also provides direct coarse supervision for normal map estimation.

We call this problem Unifying Heterogeneous Classifiers (UHC). This problem is motivated by scenarios where data is collected from multiple sources, but the sources cannot share their data, e.g., due to privacy concerns, and only privately trained models can be shared. In addition, each source may not be able to gather data to train all classes due to data availability at each source, and may not be able to train the same classification model due to different computational resources. To tackle this problem, we propose a generalisation of knowledge distillation to merge HCs. We derive a probabilistic relation between the outputs of HCs and the probability over all classes. Based on this relation, we propose two classes of methods based on cross-entropy minimisation and matrix factorisation, which allow us to estimate soft labels over all classes from unlabelled samples and use them in lieu of ground truth labels to train a unified classifier. Our extensive experiments on ImageNet, LSUN, and Places365 datasets show that our approaches significantly outperform a naive extension of distillation and can achieve almost the same accuracy as classifiers that are trained in a centralised, supervised manner.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unifying,Heterogeneous,Classifiers,With,Distillation"

We set up a 2 session factorial experimental design in which humans visually search for a target  with and without a Deep Learning (DL) expert system. We evaluate human changes of target detection performance and eye-movements in the presence of the DL system. We find that performance improvements with the DL system (computed via a Faster R-CNN with a VGG16) interacts with observer's perceptual abilities (e.g., sensitivity). The main results include: 1) The DL system reduces the False Alarm rate per Image on average across observer groups of both high/low sensitivity; 2) Only human observers with high sensitivity perform better than the DL system, while the low sensitivity group does not surpass individual DL system performance, even when aided with the DL system itself; 3) Increases in number of trials and decrease in viewing time were mainly driven by the DL system only for the low sensitivity group. 4) The DL system aids the human observer to fixate at a target by the 3rd fixation.

This is in contrast with the most widely used MTL CNN structures which empirically or heuristically share features on some specific layers (e.g., share all the features except the last convolutional layer). The proposed layerwise feature fusing scheme is formulated by combining existing CNN components in a novel way, with clear mathematical interpretability as discriminative dimensionality reduction, which is referred to as Neural Discriminative Dimensionality Reduction (NDDR). Specifically, we first concatenate features with the same spatial resolution from different tasks according to their channel dimension. Then, we show that the discriminative dimensionality reduction can be fulfilled by 1x1 Convolution, Batch Normalization, and Weight Decay in one CNN. The use of existing CNN components ensures the end-to-end training and the extensibility of the proposed NDDR layer to various state-of-the-art CNN architectures in a ""plug-and-play"" manner. The detailed ablation analysis shows that the proposed NDDR layer is easy to train and also robust to different hyperparameters.

The CSG measure is derived from the probabilistic divergence between classes in a spectral clustering framework. We show that this metric correlates with the overall separability of the dataset and thus its inherent complexity. As will be shown, our metric can be used for dataset reduction, to assess which classes are more difficult to disentangle, and approximate the accuracy one could expect to get with a CNN.

To achieve that, we first endow the state of the art PPF-FoldNet auto-encoder (AE) with a pose-variant sibling, where the discrepancy between the two leads to pose-specific descriptors. Based upon this, we introduce RelativeNet, a relative pose estimation network to assign correspondence-specific orientations to the keypoints, eliminating any local reference frame computations. Finally, we devise a simple yet effective hypothesize-and-verify algorithm to quickly use the predictions and align two point sets.

328,HPLFlowNet: Hierarchical Permutohedral Lattice FlowNet for Scene Flow Estimation on Large-Scale Point Clouds,"We present a novel deep neural network architecture for end-to-end scene flow estimation that directly operates on large-scale 3D point clouds. Inspired by Bilateral Convolutional Layers (BCL), we propose novel DownBCL, UpBCL, and CorrBCL operations that restore structural information from unstructured point clouds, and fuse information from two consecutive point clouds. Operating on discrete and sparse permutohedral lattice points, our architectural design is parsimonious in computational cost. Our model can efficiently process a pair of point cloud frames at once with a maximum of 86K points per frame. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow 2015 datasets.

329,GPSfM: Global Projective SFM Using Algebraic Constraints on Multi-View Fundamental Matrices,"This paper addresses the problem of recovering projective camera matrices from collections of fundamental matrices in multiview settings. We make two main contributions. First, given  n \choose 2  fundamental matrices computed for n images, we provide a complete algebraic characterization in the form of conditions that are both necessary and sufficient to enabling the recovery of camera matrices. These conditions are based on arranging the fundamental matrices as blocks in a single matrix, called the n-view fundamental matrix, and characterizing this matrix in terms of the signs of its eigenvalues and rank structures. Secondly, we propose a concrete algorithm for projective structure-from-motion that utilizes this characterization. Given a complete or  partial collection of measured fundamental matrices,  our method seeks camera matrices that minimize a global algebraic error for the measured fundamental matrices. In contrast to existing methods, our optimization, without any initialization,  produces a consistent set of fundamental matrices that corresponds to a unique set of cameras (up to a choice of projective frame).  Our experiments indicate that our method achieves state of the art performance in both accuracy and running time.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"GPSfM:,Global,Projective,SFM,Using,Algebraic,Constraints,on,Multi-View,Fundamental,Matrices"
330,Group-Wise Correlation Stereo Network,"Stereo matching estimates the disparity between a rectified image pair, which is of great importance to depth sensing, autonomous driving, and other related tasks. Previous works built cost volumes with cross-correlation or concatenation of left and right features across all disparity levels, and then a 2D or 3D convolutional neural network is utilized to regress the disparity maps. In this paper, we propose to construct the cost volume by group-wise correlation. The left features and the right features are divided into groups along the channel dimension, and correlation maps are computed among each group to obtain multiple matching cost proposals, which are then packed into a cost volume. Group-wise correlation provides efficient representations for measuring feature similarities and will not lose too much information like full correlation. It also preserves better performance when reducing parameters compared with previous methods. The 3D stacked hourglass network proposed in previous works is improved to boost the performance and decrease the inference computational cost. Experiment results show that our method outperforms previous methods on Scene Flow, KITTI 2012, and KITTI 2015 datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Group-Wise,Correlation,Stereo,Network"
331,Multi-Level Context Ultra-Aggregation for Stereo Matching,"Exploiting multi-level context information to cost volume can improve the performance of learning-based stereo matching methods. In recent years, 3-D Convolution Neural Networks (3-D CNNs) show the advantages in regularizing cost volume but are limited by unary features learning in matching cost computation. However, existing methods only use features from plain convolution layers or a simple aggregation of multi-level features to calculate cost volume, which is insufficient because stereo matching requires discriminative features to identify corresponding pixels in rectified stereo image pairs. In this paper, we propose a unary features descriptor using multi-level context ultra-aggregation (MCUA), which encapsulates all convolutional features into a more discriminative representation by intra- and inter-level features combination. Specifically, a child module that takes low-resolution images as input captures larger context information; the larger context information from each layer is densely connected to the main branch of the network. MCUA makes good usage of multi-level features with richer context and performs the image-to-image prediction holistically. We introduce our MCUA scheme for cost volume calculation and test it on PSM-Net. We also evaluate our method on Scene Flow and KITTI 2012/2015 stereo datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin and effectively improves the accuracy of stereo matching.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Level,Context,Ultra-Aggregation,for,Stereo,Matching"

We build on recent developments in algorithms for absolute and relative pose recovery for generalised cameras and couple them with multi-view triangulation in a robust framework that advances the state-of-the-art on 3D reconstruction from LFs in several ways. First, our framework can recover the scale of a scene. Second, it is concerned with unordered sets of LF images, meticulously determining the order in which images should be considered. Third, it can scale to datasets with hundreds of LF images. Finally, it recovers 3D scene structure while abstaining from triangulating using very small baselines.

333,Understanding the Limitations of CNN-Based Absolute Camera Pose Regression,"Visual localization is the task of accurate camera pose estimation in a known scene. It is a key problem in computer vision and robotics, with applications including self-driving cars, Structure-from-Motion, SLAM, and Mixed Reality. Traditionally, the localization problem has been tackled using 3D geometry. Recently, end-to-end approaches based on convolutional neural networks have become popular. These methods learn to directly regress the camera pose from an input image. However, they do not achieve the same level of pose accuracy as 3D structure-based methods. To understand this behavior, we develop a theoretical model for camera pose regression. We use our model to predict failure cases for pose regression techniques and verify our predictions through experiments. We furthermore use our model to show that pose regression is more closely related to pose approximation via image retrieval than to accurate pose estimation via 3D structure. A key result is that current approaches do not consistently outperform a handcrafted image retrieval baseline. This clearly shows that additional research is needed before pose regression algorithms are ready to compete with structure-based methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Understanding,the,Limitations,of,CNN-Based,Absolute,Camera,Pose,Regression"
334,DeepLiDAR: Deep Surface Normal Guided Depth Prediction for Outdoor Scene From Sparse LiDAR Data and Single Color Image,"In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture that produces accurate dense depth for the outdoor scene from a single color image and a sparse depth. Inspired by the indoor depth completion, our network estimates surface normals as the intermediate representation to produce dense depth, and can be trained end-to-end. With a modified encoder-decoder structure, our network effectively fuses the dense color image and the sparse LiDAR depth. To address outdoor specific challenges, our network predicts a confidence mask to handle mixed LiDAR signals near foreground boundaries due to occlusion, and combines estimates from the color image and surface normals with learned attention maps to improve the depth accuracy especially for distant areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model improves upon the state-of-the-art performance on KITTI depth completion benchmark. Ablation study shows the positive impact of each model components to the final performance, and comprehensive analysis shows that our model generalizes well to the input with higher sparsity or from indoor scenes.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DeepLiDAR:,Deep,Surface,Normal,Guided,Depth,Prediction,for,Outdoor,Scene,From,Sparse,LiDAR,Data,and,Single,Color,Image"
335,Modeling Point Clouds With Self-Attention and Gumbel Subset Sampling,"Geometric deep learning is increasingly important thanks to the popularity of 3D sensors. Inspired by the recent advances in NLP domain, the self-attention transformer is introduced to consume the point clouds. We develop Point Attention Transformers (PATs), using a parameter-efficient Group Shuffle Attention (GSA) to replace the costly Multi-Head Attention. We demonstrate its ability to process size-varying inputs, and prove its permutation equivariance. Besides, prior work uses heuristics dependence on the input data (e.g., Furthest Point Sampling) to hierarchically select subsets of input points. Thereby, we for the first time propose an end-to-end learnable and task-agnostic sampling operation, named Gumbel Subset Sampling (GSS), to select a representative subset of input points. Equipped with Gumbel-Softmax, it produces a ""soft"" continuous subset in training phase, and a ""hard"" discrete subset in test phase. By selecting representative subsets in a hierarchical fashion, the networks learn a stronger representation of the input sets with lower computation cost. Experiments on classification and segmentation benchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel application, to process event camera stream as point clouds, and achieve a state-of-the-art performance on DVS128 Gesture Dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Modeling,Point,Clouds,With,Self-Attention,and,Gumbel,Subset,Sampling"
336,Learning With Batch-Wise Optimal Transport Loss for 3D Shape Recognition,"Deep metric learning is essential for visual recognition. The widely used pair-wise (or triplet) based loss objectives cannot make full use of semantical information in training samples or give enough attention to those hard samples during optimization. Thus, they often suffer from a slow convergence rate and inferior performance. In this paper, we show how to learn an importance-driven distance metric via optimal transport programming from batches of samples. It can automatically emphasize hard examples and lead to significant improvements in convergence. We propose a new batch-wise optimal transport loss and combine it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. We use it to learn the distance metric and deep feature representation jointly for recognition. Empirical results on visual retrieval and classification tasks with six  benchmark datasets, i.e., MNIST,  CIFAR10, SHREC13, SHREC14,  ModelNet10, and ModelNet40, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.  It can accelerate the convergence rate significantly while achieving a state-of-the-art recognition performance. For example, in 3D shape recognition experiments, we show that our method can achieve better recognition performance  within only 5 epochs than what can be obtained by mainstream 3D shape recognition approaches after 200 epochs.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,With,Batch-Wise,Optimal,Transport,Loss,for,3D,Shape,Recognition"
337,DenseFusion: 6D Object Pose Estimation by Iterative Dense Fusion,"A key technical challenge in performing 6D object pose estimation from RGB-D image is to fully leverage the two complementary data sources. Prior works either extract information from the RGB image and depth separately or use costly post-processing steps, limiting their performances in highly cluttered scenes and real-time applications. In this work, we present DenseFusion, a generic framework for estimating 6D pose of a set of known objects from RGB-D images. DenseFusion is a heterogeneous architecture that processes the two data sources individually and uses a novel dense fusion network to extract pixel-wise dense feature embedding, from which the pose is estimated. Furthermore, we integrate an end-to-end iterative pose refinement procedure that further improves the pose estimation while achieving near real-time inference. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in two datasets, YCB-Video and LineMOD.

While the lidar may provide a depth value for a small percentage of the pixels, we exploit regularities reflected in the training set to complete the map so as to have a probability over depth for each pixel in the image. We exploit a Conditional Prior Network, that allows associating a probability to each depth value given an image, and combine it with a likelihood term that uses the sparse measurements. Optionally we can also exploit the availability of stereo during training, but in any case only require a single image and a sparse point cloud at run-time. We test our approach on both unsupervised and supervised depth completion using the KITTI benchmark, and improve the state-of-the-art in both.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dense,Depth,Posterior,(DDP),From,Single,Image,and,Sparse,Range"

To achieve better prediction accuracy, our method leverages two projections of the panorama at once, namely the equirectangular panorama-view and the perspective ceiling-view, that each contains different clues about the room layouts. Our network architecture consists of two encoder-decoder branches for analyzing each of the two views. In addition, a novel feature fusion structure is proposed to connect the two branches, which are then jointly trained to predict the 2D floor plans and layout heights. To learn more complex room layouts, we introduce the Realtor360  dataset that contains panoramas of Manhattan-world room layouts with different numbers of corners. Experimental results show that our work outperforms recent state-of-the-art in prediction accuracy and performance, especially in the rooms with non-cuboid layouts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"DuLa-Net:,A,Dual-Projection,Network,for,Estimating,Room,Layouts,From,a,Single,RGB,Panorama"

Within a single temporally constrained recurrent network, our approach uniquely takes advantage of a complex series of skip connections, adversarial training and the temporal constraint of sequential frame recurrence to produce consistent depth and semantic class labels simultaneously.

341,Segmentation-Driven 6D Object Pose Estimation,"The most recent trend in estimating the 6D pose of rigid objects has been to train deep networks to either directly regress the pose from the image or to predict the 2D locations of 3D keypoints, from which the pose can be obtained using a PnP algorithm. In both cases, the object is treated as a global entity, and a single pose estimate is computed. As a consequence, the resulting techniques can be vulnerable to large occlusions.   In this paper, we introduce a segmentation-driven 6D pose estimation framework where each visible part of the objects contributes a local pose prediction in the form of 2D keypoint locations. We then use a predicted measure of confidence to combine these pose candidates into a robust set of 3D-to-2D correspondences, from which a reliable pose estimate can be obtained. We outperform the state-of-the-art on the challenging Occluded-LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets, which is evidence that our approach deals well with multiple poorly-textured objects occluding each other. Furthermore, it relies on a simple enough architecture to achieve real-time performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Segmentation-Driven,6D,Object,Pose,Estimation"

Unlike previous algorithms which operate on single frames, we show that reconstructing a person over an entire sequence gives extra constraints that can resolve ambiguities. This is because videos often give multiple views of a person, yet the overall body shape does not change and 3D positions vary slowly. Our method improves not only on standard mocap-based datasets like Human 3.6M -- where we show quantitative improvements -- but also on challenging in-the-wild datasets such as Kinetics. Building upon our algorithm, we present a new dataset of more than 3 million frames of YouTube videos from Kinetics with automatically generated 3D poses and meshes. We show that retraining a single-frame 3D pose estimator on this data improves accuracy on both real-world and mocap data by evaluating on the 3DPW and HumanEVA datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Exploiting,Temporal,Context,for,3D,Human,Pose,Estimation,in,the,Wild"

All existing techniques are united by the idea of having an encoder-decoder network that performs non-trivial reasoning about the 3D structure of the output space. In this work, we set up two alternative approaches that perform image classification and retrieval respectively. These simple baselines yield better results than state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We show that encoder-decoder methods are statistically indistinguishable from these baselines, thus indicating that the current state of the art in single-view object reconstruction does not actually perform reconstruction but image classification. We identify aspects of popular experimental procedures that elicit this behavior and discuss ways to improve the current state of research.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"What,Do,Single-View,3D,Reconstruction,Networks,Learn?"
344,UniformFace: Learning Deep Equidistributed Representation for Face Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a new supervision objective named uniform loss to learn deep equidistributed representations for face recognition. Most existing methods aim to learn discriminative face features, encouraging large inter-class distances and small intra-class variations. However, they ignore the distribution of faces in the holistic feature space, which may lead to severe locality and unbalance. With the prior that faces lie on a hypersphere manifold, we impose an equidistributed constraint by uniformly spreading the class centers on the manifold, so that the minimum distance between class centers can be maximized through complete exploitation of the feature space. To this end, we consider the class centers as like charges on the surface of hypersphere with inter-class repulsion, and minimize the total electric potential energy as the uniform loss. Extensive experimental results on the MegaFace Challenge I, IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A), Youtube Faces (YTF) and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed uniform loss.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"UniformFace:,Learning,Deep,Equidistributed,Representation,for,Face,Recognition"
345,Semantic Graph Convolutional Networks for 3D Human Pose Regression,"In this paper, we study the problem of learning Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for regression. Current architectures of GCNs are limited to the small receptive field of convolution filters and shared transformation matrix for each node. To address these limitations, we propose Semantic Graph Convolutional Networks (SemGCN), a novel neural network architecture that operates on regression tasks with graph-structured data. SemGCN learns to capture semantic information such as local and global node relationships, which is not explicitly represented in the graph. These semantic relationships can be learned through end-to-end training from the ground truth without additional supervision or hand-crafted rules. We further investigate applying SemGCN to 3D human pose regression. Our formulation is intuitive and sufficient since both 2D and 3D human poses can be represented as a structured graph encoding the relationships between joints in the skeleton of a human body. We carry out comprehensive studies to validate our method. The results prove that SemGCN outperforms state of the art while using 90% fewer parameters.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semantic,Graph,Convolutional,Networks,for,3D,Human,Pose,Regression"

In this paper, we argue about three issues in existing techniques: diversity, quality, and controllability for portrait synthesis and editing. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework that leverages conditional GANs guided by provided face masks for generating faces. The framework learns feature embeddings for every face component (e.g., mouth, hair, eye), separately, contributing to better correspondences for image translation, and local face editing. With the mask, our network is available to many applications, like face synthesis driven by mask, face Swap+ (including hair in swapping), and local manipulation. It can also boost the performance of face parsing a bit as an option of data augmentation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Mask-Guided,Portrait,Editing,With,Conditional,GANs"
347,Group Sampling for Scale Invariant Face Detection,"Detectors based on deep learning tend to detect multi-scale faces on a single input image for efficiency. Recent works, such as FPN and SSD, generally use feature maps from multiple layers with different spatial resolutions to detect objects at different scales, e.g., high-resolution feature maps for small objects. However, we find that such multi-layer prediction is not necessary. Faces at all scales can be well detected with features from a single layer of the network. In this paper, we carefully examine the factors affecting face detection across a large range of scales, and conclude that the balance of training samples, including both positive and negative ones, at different scales is the key. We propose a group sampling method which divides the anchors into several groups according to the scale, and ensure that the number of samples for each group is the same during training. Our approach using only the last layer of FPN as features is able to advance the state-of-the-arts. Comprehensive analysis and extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach, evaluated on face detection benchmarks including FDDB and WIDER FACE datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Group,Sampling,for,Scale,Invariant,Face,Detection"
348,Joint Representation and Estimator Learning for Facial Action Unit Intensity Estimation,"Facial action unit (AU) intensity is an index to characterize human expressions. Accurate AU intensity estimation depends on three major elements: image representation, intensity estimator, and supervisory information. Most existing methods learn intensity estimator with fixed image representation, and rely on the availability of fully annotated supervisory information. In this paper, a novel general framework for AU intensity estimation is presented, which differs from traditional estimation methods in two aspects. First, rather than keeping image representation fixed, it simultaneously learns representation and intensity estimator to achieve an optimal solution. Second, it allows incorporating weak supervisory training signal from human knowledge (e.g. feature smoothness, label smoothness, label ranking, and positive label), which makes our model trainable even fully annotated information is not available. More specifically, human knowledge is represented as either soft or hard constraints which are encoded as regularization terms or equality/inequality constraints, respectively. On top of our novel framework, we additionally propose an efficient algorithm for optimization based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Evaluations on two benchmark databases show that our method outperforms competing methods under different ratios of AU intensity annotations, especially for small ratios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Joint,Representation,and,Estimator,Learning,for,Facial,Action,Unit,Intensity,Estimation"
349,Semantic Alignment: Finding Semantically Consistent Ground-Truth for Facial Landmark Detection,"Recently, deep learning based facial landmark detection has achieved great success. Despite this, we notice that the semantic ambiguity greatly degrades the detection performance. Specifically, the semantic ambiguity means that some landmarks (e.g. those evenly distributed along the face contour) do not have clear and accurate definition, causing the inconsistent annotations (random errors) introduced by annotators. Accordingly, these inconsistent annotations, which are usually provided by public databases, commonly work as the (inaccurate) groundtruth to supervise network training, leading to the degraded accuracy. To our knowledge, very little research has investigated this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model which introduces a latent variable, i.e. 'real' groundtruth which is semantically consistent, to optimize. This framework couples two parts (1) training landmark detection CNN and (2) searching the 'real' groundtruth. These two parts are alternatively optimized: the searched 'real' groundtruth supervises the CNN training; and the trained CNN assists the searching of 'real' groundtruth. In addition, to correct or recover the unconfidently predicted landmarks due to occlusion and low quality, we propose a global heatmap correction unit (GHCU) to correct outliers by considering the global face shape as a constraint. Extensive experiments on both image-based (300V and AFLW) and video-based (300VW) databases demonstrate that our method effectively improves the landmark detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semantic,Alignment:,Finding,Semantically,Consistent,Ground-Truth,for,Facial,Landmark,Detection"

To this end, this paper addresses the problem of detecting people Looking At Each Other (LAEO) in video sequences. For this purpose, we propose LAEO-Net, a new deep CNN for determining LAEO in videos. In contrast to previous works, LAEO-Net takes spatio-temporal tracks as input and reasons about the whole track. It consists of three branches, one for each character's tracked head and one for their relative position. Moreover, we introduce two new LAEO datasets: UCO-LAEO and AVA-LAEO. A thorough experimental evaluation demonstrates the ability of LAEO-Net to successfully determine if two people are LAEO and the temporal window where it happens.

351,Robust Facial Landmark Detection via Occlusion-Adaptive Deep Networks,"In this paper, we present a simple and effective framework called Occlusion-adaptive Deep Networks (ODN) with the purpose of solving the occlusion problem for facial landmark detection. In this model, the occlusion probability of each position in high-level features are inferred by a distillation module that can be learnt automatically in the process of estimating the relationship between facial appearance and facial shape. The occlusion probability serves as the adaptive weight on high-level features to reduce the impact of occlusion and obtain clean feature representation. Nevertheless, the clean feature representation cannot represent the holistic face due to the missing semantic features. To obtain exhaustive and complete feature representation, it is vital that we leverage a low-rank learning module to recover lost features. Considering that facial geometric characteristics are conducive to the low-rank module to recover lost features, we propose a geometry-aware module to excavate geometric relationships between different facial components. Depending on the synergistic effect of three modules, the proposed network achieves better performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Robust,Facial,Landmark,Detection,via,Occlusion-Adaptive,Deep,Networks"

353,"Face Anti-Spoofing: Model Matters, so Does Data","Face anti-spoofing is an important task in full-stack face applications including face detection, verification, and recognition. Previous approaches build models on datasets which do not simulate the real-world data well (e.g., small scale, insignificant variance, etc.). Existing models may rely on auxiliary information, which prevents these anti-spoofing solutions from generalizing well in practice. In this paper, we present a data collection solution along with a data synthesis technique to simulate digital medium-based face spoofing attacks, which can easily help us obtain a large amount of training data well reflecting the real-world scenarios. Through exploiting a novel Spatio-Temporal Anti-Spoof Network (STASN), we are able to push the performance on public face anti-spoofing datasets over state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Since the proposed model can automatically attend to discriminative regions, it makes analyzing the behaviors of the network possible.We conduct extensive experiments and show that the proposed model can distinguish spoof faces by extracting features from a variety of regions to seek out subtle evidences such as borders, moire patterns, reflection artifacts, etc.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Face,Anti-Spoofing:,Model,Matters,,so,Does,Data"

This leads to the development of heavy models with poor scalability and cost-effectiveness in practical use. In this work, we investigate the under-studied but practically critical pose model efficiency problem. To this end, we present a new Fast Pose Distillation (FPD) model learning strategy. Specifically, the FPD trains a lightweight pose neural network architecture capable of executing rapidly with low computational cost. It is achieved by effectively transferring the pose structure knowledge of a strong teacher network. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantages of our FPD method over a broad range of state-of-the-art pose estimation approaches in terms of model cost-effectiveness on two standard benchmark datasets, MPII Human Pose and Leeds Sports Pose.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Fast,Human,Pose,Estimation"
355,Decorrelated Adversarial Learning for Age-Invariant Face Recognition,"There has been an increasing research interest in age-invariant face recognition. However, matching faces with big age gaps remains a challenging problem, primarily due to the significant discrepancy of face appearance caused by aging. To reduce such discrepancy, in this paper we present a novel algorithm to remove age-related components from features mixed with both identity and age information. Specifically, we factorize a mixed face feature into two uncorrelated components: identity-dependent component and age-dependent component, where the identity-dependent component contains information that is useful for face recognition. To implement this idea, we propose the Decorrelated Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm, where a Canonical Mapping Module (CMM) is introduced to find maximum correlation of the paired features generated by the backbone network, while the backbone network and the factorization module are trained to generate features reducing the correlation. Thus, the proposed model learns the decomposed features of age and identity whose correlation is significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the identity-dependent feature and the age-dependent feature are supervised by ID and age preserving signals respectively to ensure they contain the correct information. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the popular public-domain face aging datasets (FG-NET, MORPH Album 2, and CACD-VS) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Decorrelated,Adversarial,Learning,for,Age-Invariant,Face,Recognition"
356,Cross-Task Weakly Supervised Learning From Instructional Videos,"In this paper we investigate learning visual models for the steps of ordinary tasks using weak supervision via instructional narrations and an ordered list of steps instead of strong supervision via temporal annotations. At the heart of our approach is the observation that weakly supervised learning may be easier if a model shares components while learning different steps: ""pour egg"" should be trained jointly with other tasks involving ""pour"" and ""egg"".  We formalize this in a component model for recognizing steps and a weakly supervised learning framework that can learn this model under temporal constraints from narration and the list of steps.  Past data does not permit systematic studying of sharing and so we also gather a new dataset aimed at assessing cross-task sharing. Our experiments demonstrate that sharing across tasks improves performance, especially when done at the component level and that our component model can parse previously unseen tasks by virtue of its compositionality.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cross-Task,Weakly,Supervised,Learning,From,Instructional,Videos"
357,D3TW: Discriminative Differentiable Dynamic Time Warping for Weakly Supervised Action Alignment and Segmentation,"We address weakly supervised action alignment and segmentation in videos, where only the order of occurring actions is available during training. We propose Discriminative Differentiable Dynamic Time Warping (D3TW), the first discriminative model using weak ordering supervision. The key technical challenge for discriminative modeling with weak supervision is that the loss function of the ordering supervision is usually formulated using dynamic programming and is thus not differentiable. We address this challenge with a continuous relaxation of the min-operator in dynamic programming and extend the alignment loss to be differentiable. The proposed D3TW innovatively solves sequence alignment with discriminative modeling and end-to-end training, which substantially improves the performance in weakly supervised action alignment and segmentation tasks. We show that our model is able to bypass the degenerated sequence problem usually encountered in previous work and outperform the current state-of-the-art across three evaluation metrics in two challenging datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"D3TW:,Discriminative,Differentiable,Dynamic,Time,Warping,for,Weakly,Supervised,Action,Alignment,and,Segmentation"
358,Progressive Teacher-Student Learning for Early Action Prediction,"The goal of early action prediction is to recognize actions from partially observed videos with incomplete action executions, which is quite different from action recognition. Predicting early actions is very challenging since the partially observed videos do not contain enough action information for recognition. In this paper, we aim at improving early action prediction by proposing a novel teacher-student learning framework. Our framework involves a teacher model for recognizing actions from full videos, a student model for predicting early actions from partial videos, and a teacher-student learning block for distilling progressive knowledge from teacher to student, crossing different tasks. Extensive experiments on three public action datasets show that the proposed progressive teacher-student learning framework can consistently improve performance of early action prediction model. We have also reported the state-of-the-art performances for early action prediction on all of these sets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Progressive,Teacher-Student,Learning,for,Early,Action,Prediction"
359,Social Relation Recognition From Videos via Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Reasoning,"Discovering social relations, e.g., kinship, friendship, etc., from visual contents can make machines better interpret the behaviors and emotions of human beings. Existing studies mainly focus on recognizing social relations from still images while neglecting another important media--video. On one hand, the actions and storylines in videos provide more important cues for social relation recognition. On the other hand, the key persons may appear at arbitrary spatial-temporal locations, even not in one same image from beginning to the end. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Reasoning (MSTR) framework to recognize social relations from videos. For the spatial representation, we not only adopt a temporal segment network to learn global action and scene information, but also design a Triple Graphs model to capture visual relations between persons and objects. For the temporal domain, we propose a Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network to perform temporal reasoning with multi-scale receptive fields, which can obtain both long-term and short-term storylines in videos. By this means, MSTR can comprehensively explore the multi-scale actions and storylines in spatial-temporal dimensions for social relation reasoning in videos. Extensive experiments on a new large-scale Video Social Relation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Social,Relation,Recognition,From,Videos,via,Multi-Scale,Spatial-Temporal,Reasoning"
360,MS-TCN: Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network for Action Segmentation,"Temporally locating and classifying action segments in long untrimmed videos is of particular interest to many applications like surveillance and robotics. While traditional approaches follow a two-step pipeline, by generating frame-wise probabilities and then feeding them to high-level temporal models, recent approaches use temporal convolutions to directly classify the video frames. In this paper, we introduce a multi-stage architecture for the temporal action segmentation task. Each stage features a set of dilated temporal convolutions to generate an initial prediction that is refined by the next one. This architecture is trained using a combination of a classification loss and a proposed smoothing loss that penalizes over-segmentation errors. Extensive evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed model in capturing long-range dependencies and recognizing action segments. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging datasets: 50Salads, Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), and the Breakfast dataset.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MS-TCN:,Multi-Stage,Temporal,Convolutional,Network,for,Action,Segmentation"

In this paper, we explore Interactiveness Knowledge which indicates whether human and object interact with each other or not. We found that interactiveness knowledge can be learned across HOI datasets, regardless of HOI category settings. Our core idea is to exploit an Interactiveness Network to learn the general interactiveness knowledge from multiple HOI datasets and perform Non-Interaction Suppression before HOI classification in inference. On account of the generalization of interactiveness, interactiveness network is a transferable knowledge learner and can be cooperated with any HOI detection models to achieve desirable results. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art HOI detection results by a great margin, verifying its efficacy and flexibility.

362,Actional-Structural Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,"Action recognition with skeleton data has recently attracted much attention in computer vision. Previous studies are mostly based on fixed skeleton graphs, only capturing local physical dependencies among joints, which may miss implicit joint correlations. To capture richer dependencies, we introduce an encoder-decoder structure, called A-link inference module, to capture action-specific latent dependencies, i.e. actional links, directly from actions. We also extend the existing skeleton graphs to represent higher-order dependencies, i.e. structural links. Combing the two types of links into a generalized skeleton graph, We further propose the actional-structural graph convolution network (AS-GCN), which stacks actional-structural graph convolution and temporal convolution as a basic building block, to learn both spatial and temporal features for action recognition. A future pose prediction head is added in parallel to the recognition head to help capture more detailed action patterns through self-supervision. We validate AS-GCN in action recognition using two skeleton data sets, NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics. The proposed AS-GCN achieves consistently large improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods. As a side product, AS-GCN also shows promising results for future pose prediction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Actional-Structural,Graph,Convolutional,Networks,for,Skeleton-Based,Action,Recognition"
363,Multi-Granularity Generator for Temporal Action Proposal,"Temporal action proposal generation is an important task, aiming to localize the video segments containing human actions in an untrimmed video. In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity generator (MGG) to perform the temporal action proposal from different granularity perspectives, relying on the video visual features equipped with the position embedding information. First, we propose to use a bilinear matching model to exploit the rich local information within the video sequence. Afterwards, two components, namely segment proposal producer (SPP) and frame actionness producer (FAP), are combined to perform the task of temporal action proposal at two distinct granularities. SPP considers the whole video in the form of feature pyramid and generates segment proposals from one coarse perspective, while FAP carries out a finer actionness evaluation for each video frame. Our proposed MGG can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Through temporally adjusting the segment proposals with fine-grained information based on frame actionness, MGG achieves the superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on the public THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets. Moreover, we employ existing action classifiers to perform the classification of the proposals generated by MGG, leading to significant improvements compared against the competing methods for the video detection task.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Multi-Granularity,Generator,for,Temporal,Action,Proposal"

We formulate the problem as energy minimization in a deep structured model, which can be solved efficiently in the GPU by unrolling a Gaussian-Newton solver.  Our experiments in the challenging KITTI scene flow dataset show that we outperform the state-of-the-art by a very large margin, while being 800 times faster.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Rigid,Instance,Scene,Flow"

We emphasize the importance of inherent correlation among video frames and incorporate a global co-attention mechanism to improve further the state-of-the-art deep learning based solutions that primarily focus on learning discriminative foreground representations over appearance and motion in short-term temporal segments. The co-attention layers in our network provide efficient and competent stages for capturing global correlations and scene context by jointly computing and appending co-attention responses into a joint feature space. We train COSNet with pairs of video frames, which naturally augments training data and allows increased learning capacity. During the segmentation stage, the co-attention model encodes useful information by processing multiple reference frames together, which is leveraged to infer the frequently reappearing and salient foreground objects better. We propose a unified and end-to-end trainable framework where different co-attention variants can be derived for mining the rich context within videos. Our extensive experiments over three large benchmarks manifest that COSNet outperforms the current alternatives by a large margin.

In this work, we overcome this problem by proposing a patch-based unsupervised learning framework in order to learn discriminative feature from patches instead of the whole images. The patch-based learning leverages similarity between patches to learn a discriminative model. Specifically, we develop a PatchNet to select patches from the feature map and learn discriminative features for these patches. To provide effective guidance for the PatchNet to learn discriminative patch feature on unlabeled datasets, we propose an unsupervised patch-based discriminative feature learning loss. In addition, we design an image-level feature learning loss to leverage all the patch features of the same image to serve as an image-level guidance for the PatchNet. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method for unsupervised person re-id.

367,SPM-Tracker: Series-Parallel Matching for Real-Time Visual Object Tracking,"The greatest challenge facing visual object tracking is the simultaneous requirements on robustness and discrimination power. In this paper, we propose a SiamFC-based tracker, named SPM-Tracker, to tackle this challenge. The basic idea is to address the two requirements in two separate matching stages. Robustness is strengthened in the coarse matching (CM) stage through generalized training while discrimination power is enhanced in the fine matching (FM) stage through a distance learning network. The two stages are connected in series as the input proposals of the FM stage are generated by the CM stage. They are also connected in parallel as the matching scores and box location refinements are fused to generate the final results. This innovative series-parallel structure takes advantage of both stages and results in superior performance. The proposed SPM-Tracker, running at 120fps on GPU, achieves an AUC of 0.687 on OTB-100 and an EAO of 0.434 on VOT-16, exceeding other real-time trackers by a notable margin.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"SPM-Tracker:,Series-Parallel,Matching,for,Real-Time,Visual,Object,Tracking"
368,Spatial Fusion GAN for Image Synthesis,"Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great potentials in realistic image synthesis whereas most existing works address synthesis realism in either appearance space or geometry space but few in both. This paper presents an innovative Spatial Fusion GAN (SF-GAN) that combines a geometry synthesizer and an appearance synthesizer to achieve synthesis realism in both geometry and appearance spaces. The geometry synthesizer learns contextual geometries of background images and transforms and places foreground objects into the background images unanimously. The appearance synthesizer adjust the color, brightness and styles of the foreground objects and embeds them into background images harmoniously, where a guided filter is incorporated for detail preserving. The two synthesizers are inter-connected as mutual references which can be trained end-to-end with little supervision. The SF-GAN has been evaluated in two tasks: (1) realistic scene text image synthesis for training better recognition models; (2) glass and hat wearing for realistic matching glasses and hats with real portraits. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SF-GAN.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Spatial,Fusion,GAN,for,Image,Synthesis"

Our method can be boiled down to two stages: 1) text guided pose generation and 2) visual appearance transferred image synthesis. In the first stage, our method infers a reasonable target human pose based on the text. In the second stage, our method synthesizes a realistic and appearance transferred person image according to the text in conjunction with the target pose. Our method extracts sufficient information from the text and establishes a mapping between the image space and the language space, making generating and editing images corresponding to the description possible. We conduct extensive experiments to reveal the effectiveness of our method, as well as using the VQA Perceptual Score as a metric for evaluating the method.

370,STGAN: A Unified Selective Transfer Network for Arbitrary Image Attribute Editing,"Arbitrary attribute editing generally can be tackled by incorporating encoder-decoder and generative adversarial networks. However, the bottleneck layer in encoder-decoder usually gives rise to blurry and low quality editing result. And adding skip connections improves image quality at the cost of weakened attribute manipulation ability. Moreover, existing methods exploit target attribute vector to guide the flexible translation to desired target domain. In this work, we suggest to address these issues from selective transfer perspective. Considering that specific editing task is certainly only related to the changed attributes instead of all target attributes, our model selectively takes the difference between target and source attribute vectors as input. Furthermore, selective transfer units are incorporated with encoder-decoder to adaptively select and modify encoder feature for enhanced attribute editing. Experiments show that our method (i.e., STGAN) simultaneously improves attribute manipulation accuracy as well as perception quality, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts in arbitrary face attribute editing and season translation.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"STGAN:,A,Unified,Selective,Transfer,Network,for,Arbitrary,Image,Attribute,Editing"
371,Towards Instance-Level Image-To-Image Translation,"Unpaired Image-to-image Translation is a new rising and challenging vision problem that aims to learn a mapping between unaligned image pairs in diverse domains. Recent advances in this field like MUNIT and DRIT mainly focus on disentangling content and style/attribute from a given image first, then directly adopting the global style to guide the model to synthesize new domain images. However, this kind of approaches severely incurs contradiction if the target domain images are content-rich with multiple discrepant objects. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective instance-aware image-to-image translation approach (INIT), which employs the fine-grained local (instance) and global styles to the target image spatially. The proposed INIT exhibits three import advantages: (1) the instance-level objective loss can help learn a more accurate reconstruction and incorporate diverse attributes of objects; (2) the styles used for target domain of local/global areas are from  corresponding spatial regions in source domain, which intuitively is a more reasonable mapping; (3) the joint training process can benefit both fine and coarse granularity and incorporates instance information to improve the quality of global translation. We also collect a large-scale benchmark for the new instance-level translation task.

372,Dense Intrinsic Appearance Flow for Human Pose Transfer,"We present a novel approach for the task of human pose transfer, which aims at synthesizing a new image of a person from an input image of that person and a target pose. We address the issues of limited correspondences identified between keypoints only and invisible pixels due to self-occlusion. Unlike existing methods, we propose to estimate dense and intrinsic 3D appearance flow to better guide the transfer of pixels between poses. In particular, we wish to generate the 3D flow from just the reference and target poses. Training a network for this purpose is non-trivial, especially when the annotations for 3D appearance flow are scarce by nature. We address this problem through a flow synthesis stage. This is achieved by fitting a 3D model to the given pose pair and project them back to the 2D plane to compute the dense appearance flow for training. The synthesized ground-truths are then used to train a feedforward network for efficient mapping from the input and target skeleton poses to the 3D appearance flow. With the appearance flow, we perform feature warping on the input image and generate a photorealistic image of the target pose. Extensive results on DeepFashion and Market-1501 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods.

373,Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation,"Video frame interpolation aims to synthesize nonexistent frames in-between the original frames. While significant advances have been made from the recent deep convolutional neural networks, the quality of interpolation is often reduced due to large object motion or occlusion. In this work, we propose a video frame interpolation method which explicitly detects the occlusion by exploring the depth information. Specifically, we develop a depth-aware flow projection layer to synthesize intermediate flows that preferably sample closer objects than farther ones. In addition, we learn hierarchical features to gather contextual information from neighboring pixels. The proposed model then warps the input frames, depth maps, and contextual features based on the optical flow and local interpolation kernels for synthesizing the output frame. Our model is compact, efficient, and fully differentiable. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against state-of-the-art frame interpolation methods on a wide variety of datasets.

374,Sliced Wasserstein Generative Models,"In generative modeling, the Wasserstein distance (WD) has emerged as a useful metric to measure the discrepancy between generated and real data distributions. Unfortunately, it is challenging to approximate the WD of high-dimensional distributions. In contrast, the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) factorizes high-dimensional distributions into their multiple one-dimensional marginal distributions and is thus easier to approximate.  In this paper, we introduce novel approximations of the primal and dual SWD. Instead of using a large number of random projections, as it is done by conventional SWD approximation methods, we propose to approximate SWDs with a small number of parameterized orthogonal projections in an end-to-end deep learning fashion. As concrete applications of our SWD approximations, we design two types of differentiable SWD blocks to equip modern generative frameworks---Auto-Encoders (AE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).  In the experiments, we not only show the superiority of the proposed generative models on standard image synthesis benchmarks, but also demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on challenging high resolution image and video generation in an unsupervised manner.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Sliced,Wasserstein,Generative,Models"

In this work we propose a novel flow-guided video inpainting approach. Rather than filling in the RGB pixels of each frame directly, we consider the video inpainting as a pixel propagation problem. We first synthesize a spatially and temporally coherent optical flow field across video frames using a newly designed Deep Flow Completion network, then use the synthesized flow fields to guide the propagation of pixels to fill up the missing regions in the video. Specifically, the Deep Flow Competion network follows a coarse-to-fine refinement strategy to complete the flow fields, while their quality is further improved by hard flow example mining. Following the guide of the completed flow fields, the missing video regions can be filled up precisely. Our method is evaluated on DAVIS and YouTubeVOS datasets qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving the state-of-the-art performance in terms of inpainting quality and speed.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Flow-Guided,Video,Inpainting"

Different from typical end-to-end approaches, which model both scene content and dynamics in a single step, we propose to decompose this difficult task into two sub-problems. As current image generation methods do better than video generation in terms of detail, we synthesize high quality content by only generating the first frame. Then we animate the scene based on its semantic meaning to obtain temporally coherent video, giving us excellent results overall. We employ a cVAE for predicting optical flow as a beneficial intermediate step to generate a video sequence conditioned on the initial single frame. A semantic label map is integrated into the flow prediction module to achieve major improvements in the image-to-video generation process.

When this polarizing camera is used in a setting of multiview geometric imaging, it is often required to calibrate its intrinsic and extrinsic parameters as well, for which Zhang's calibration method is the most widely used with either a physical checker board, or more conveniently a virtual checker pattern displayed on a monitor. In this paper, we propose to jointly calibrate the polarizer angles and the inverse CRF (ICRF) using a slightly adapted checker pattern displayed on a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. Thanks to the lighting principles and the industry standards of the LCD monitors, the polarimetric and radiometric calibration can be significantly simplified, when assisted by the extrinsic parameters estimated from the checker pattern. We present a simple linear method for polarizer angle calibration and a convex method for radiometric calibration, both of which can be jointly refined in a process similar to bundle adjustment.

Our model contains a colorization network for video frame colorization and a refinement network for spatiotemporal color refinement. Without any labeled data, both networks can be trained with self-regularized losses defined in bilateral and temporal space. The bilateral loss enforces color consistency between neighboring pixels in a bilateral space and the temporal loss imposes constraints between corresponding pixels in two nearby frames. While video colorization is a multi-modal problem, our method uses a perceptual loss with diversity to differentiate various modes in the solution space.

Existing learning-based super-resolution methods do not use real sensor data, instead operating on processed RGB images. We show that these approaches forfeit detail and accuracy that can be gained by operating on raw data, particularly when zooming in on distant objects. The key barrier to using real sensor data for training is that ground-truth high-resolution imagery is missing. We show how to obtain such ground-truth data via optical zoom and contribute a dataset, SR-RAW, for real-world computational zoom. We use SR-RAW to train a deep network with a novel contextual bilateral loss that is robust to mild misalignment between input and outputs images. The trained network achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4X and 8X computational zoom. We also show that synthesizing sensor data by resampling high-resolution RGB images is an oversimplified approximation of real sensor data and noise, resulting in worse image quality.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Zoom,to,Learn,,Learn,to,Zoom"
380,Single Image Reflection Removal Beyond Linearity,"Due to the lack of paired data, the training of image reflection removal relies heavily on synthesizing reflection images. However, existing methods model reflection as a linear combination model, which cannot fully simulate the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we inject non-linearity into reflection removal from two aspects. First, instead of synthesizing reflection with a fixed combination factor or kernel, we propose to synthesize reflection images by predicting a non-linear alpha blending mask. This enables a free combination of different blurry kernels, leading to a controllable and diverse reflection synthesis. Second, we design a cascaded network for reflection removal with three tasks: predicting the transmission layer, reflection layer, and the non-linear alpha blending mask. The former two tasks are the fundamental outputs, while the latter one being the side output of the network. This side output, on the other hand, making the training a closed loop, so that the separated transmission and reflection layers can be recombined together for training with a reconstruction loss. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the proposed synthesis and removal approaches outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two standard benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Single,Image,Reflection,Removal,Beyond,Linearity"

We do this by training a deep neural network to predict the per-pixel reflectance chromaticity of the scene, which we use in conjunction with a previous flash/no-flash image-based separation algorithm to produce the final two output images. We design our reflectance chromaticity network and loss functions by incorporating intuitions from the physics of image formation. We show that this leads to significantly better performance than other single image techniques and even approaches the quality of the two image separation method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Separate,Multiple,Illuminants,in,a,Single,Image"

We propose a unified code for 3D shapes, dubbed Shape Unicode, that imbibes shape cues across these representations into a single code, and a novel framework to learn such a code space for any 3D shape dataset. We discuss this framework as a single go-to training model for any input representation, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned code space by applying it directly to common shape analysis tasks -- discriminative and generative. In this work, we use three common representations -- voxel grids, point clouds and multi-view projections -- and combine them into a single code. Note that while we use all three representations at training time, the code can be derived from any single representation during testing. We evaluate this code space on shape retrieval, segmentation and correspondence, and show that the unified code performs better than the individual representations themselves. Additionally, this code space compares quite well to the representation-specific state-of-the-art in these tasks. We also qualitatively discuss linear interpolation between points in this space, by synthesizing from intermediate points.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Shape,Unicode:,A,Unified,Shape,Representation"
383,Robust Video Stabilization by Optimization in CNN Weight Space,"We propose a novel robust video stabilization method. Unlike traditional video stabilization techniques that involve complex motion models, we directly model the appearance change of the frames as the dense optical flow field of consecutive frames. We introduce a new formulation of the video stabilization task based on first principles, which leads to a large scale non-convex problem. This problem is hard to solve, so previous optical flow based approaches have resorted to heuristics. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization routine that transfers this problem into the convolutional neural network parameter domain. While we exploit the general benefits of CNNs, including standard gradient-based optimization techniques, our method is a new approach to using CNNs purely as an optimizer rather than learning from data.Our method trains the CNN from scratch on each specific input example, and intentionally overfits the CNN parameters to produce the best result on the input example. By solving the problem in the CNN weight space rather than directly for image pixels, we make it a viable formulation for video stabilization. Our method produces both visually and quantitatively better results than previous work, and is robust in situations acknowledged as limitations in current state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Robust,Video,Stabilization,by,Optimization,in,CNN,Weight,Space"

Recent algorithms based on second-order statistics, however, are either computationally expensive or prone to generate artifacts due to the trade-off between image quality and runtime performance. In this work, we present an approach for universal style transfer that learns the transformation matrix in a data-driven fashion. Our algorithm is efficient yet flexible to transfer different levels of styles with the same auto-encoder network. It also produces stable video style transfer results due to the preservation of the content affinity. In addition, we propose a linear propagation module to enable a feed-forward network for photo-realistic style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three tasks: artistic style, photo-realistic and video style transfer, with comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Linear,Transformations,for,Fast,Image,and,Video,Style,Transfer"

Stereo occlusion boundaries often coincide with object boundaries, and localizing them is useful for tasks like grasping, manipulation, and navigation. This paper describes the local signatures for stereo occlusion boundaries that exist in a stereo cost volume, and it introduces a local detector for them based on a simple feedforward network with relatively small receptive fields. The local detector produces better boundaries than many other stereo methods, even without incorporating explicit stereo matching, top-down contextual cues, or single-image boundary cues based on texture and intensity.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Local,Detection,of,Stereo,Occlusion,Boundaries"

To extract edges at dramatically different scales, we propose a Bi-Directional Cascade Network (BDCN) structure, where an individual layer is supervised by labeled edges at its specific scale, rather than directly applying the same supervision to all CNN outputs. Furthermore, to enrich multi-scale representations learned by BDCN, we introduce a Scale Enhancement Module (SEM) which utilizes dilated convolution to generate multi-scale features, instead of using deeper CNNs or explicitly fusing multi-scale edge maps. These new approaches encourage the learning of multi-scale representations in different layers and detect edges that are well delineated by their scales. Learning scale dedicated layers also results in compact network with a fraction of parameters. We evaluate our method on three datasets, i.e., BSDS500, NYUDv2, and Multicue, and achieve ODS Fmeasure of 0.828, 1.3% higher than current state-of-the art on BSDS500.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Bi-Directional,Cascade,Network,for,Perceptual,Edge,Detection"

We further provide a rich variety of criteria for dehazing algorithm evaluation, ranging from full-reference metrics, to no-reference metrics, to subjective evaluation and the novel task-driven evaluation.

388,Dynamic Scene Deblurring With Parameter Selective Sharing and Nested Skip Connections,"Dynamic Scene deblurring is a challenging low-level vision task where spatially variant blur is caused by many factors, e.g., camera shake and object motion. Recent study has made significant progress. Compared with the parameter independence scheme [19] and parameter sharing scheme [33], we develop the general principle for constraining the deblurring network structure by proposing the generic and effective selective sharing scheme. Inside the subnetwork of each scale, we propose a nested skip connection structure for the nonlinear transformation modules to replace stacked convolution layers or residual blocks. Besides, we build a new large dataset of blurred/sharp image pairs towards better restoration quality. Comprehensive experimental results show that our parameter selective sharing scheme, nested skip connection structure, and the new dataset are all significant to set a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene deblurring.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Dynamic,Scene,Deblurring,With,Parameter,Selective,Sharing,and,Nested,Skip,Connections"
389,Events-To-Video: Bringing Modern Computer Vision to Event Cameras,"Event cameras are novel sensors that report brightness changes in the form of asynchronous ""events"" instead of intensity frames. They have significant advantages over conventional cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. Since the output of event cameras is fundamentally different from conventional cameras, it is commonly accepted that they require the development of specialized algorithms to accommodate the particular nature of events. In this work, we take a different view and propose to apply existing, mature computer vision techniques to videos reconstructed from event data. We propose a novel, recurrent neural network to reconstruct videos from a stream of events and train it on a large amount of simulated event data. Our experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art reconstruction methods by a large margin (> 20%) in terms of image quality. We further apply off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms to videos reconstructed from event data on tasks such as object classification and visual-inertial odometry, and show that this strategy consistently outperforms algorithms that were specifically designed for event data. We believe that our approach opens the door to bringing the outstanding properties of event cameras to an entirely new range of tasks.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Events-To-Video:,Bringing,Modern,Computer,Vision,to,Event,Cameras"
390,Feedback Network for Image Super-Resolution,"Recent advances in image super-resolution (SR) explored the power of deep learning to achieve a better reconstruction performance. However, the feedback mechanism, which commonly exists in human visual system, has not been fully exploited in existing deep learning based image SR methods. In this paper, we propose an image super-resolution feedback network (SRFBN) to refine low-level representations with high-level information. Specifically, we use hidden states in a recurrent neural network (RNN) with constraints to achieve such feedback manner. A feedback block is designed to handle the feedback connections and to generate powerful high-level representations. The proposed SRFBN comes with a strong early reconstruction ability and can create the final high-resolution image step by step. In addition, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy to make the network well suitable for more complicated tasks, where the low-resolution images are corrupted by multiple types of degradation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SRFBN in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

391,Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning for Image Rain Removal,"Single image rain removal is a typical inverse problem in computer vision. The deep learning technique has been verified to be effective for this task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, previous deep learning methods need to pre-collect a large set of image pairs with/without synthesized rain for training, which tends to make the neural network be biased toward learning the specific patterns of the synthesized rain, while be less able to generalize to real test samples whose rain types differ from those in the training data. To this issue, this paper firstly proposes a semi-supervised learning paradigm toward this task. Different from traditional deep learning methods which only use supervised image pairs with/without synthesized rains, we further put real rainy images, without need of their clean ones, into the network training process. This is realized by elaborately formulating the residual between an input rainy image and its expected network output (clear image without rain) as a concise mixture of Gaussians distribution. The network is therefore  trained to transfer to adapting the real rain pattern domain instead of only the synthesis rain domain, and thus both the short-of-training-sample and bias-to-supervised-sample issues can be evidently alleviated. Experiments on synthetic and real data verify the superiority of our model compared to the state-of-the-arts.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Semi-Supervised,Transfer,Learning,for,Image,Rain,Removal"
392,EventNet: Asynchronous Recursive Event Processing,"Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that mimic retinas to asynchronously report per-pixel intensity changes rather than outputting an actual intensity image at regular intervals. This new paradigm of image sensor offers significant potential advantages; namely, sparse and non-redundant data representation. Unfortunately, however, most of the existing artificial neural network architectures, such as a CNN, require dense synchronous input data, and therefore, cannot make use of the sparseness of the data.  We propose EventNet, a neural network designed for real-time processing of asynchronous event streams in a recursive and event-wise manner. EventNet models dependence of the output on tens of thousands of causal events recursively using a novel temporal coding scheme. As a result, at inference time, our network operates in an event-wise manner that is realized with very few sum-of-the-product operations---look-up table and temporal feature aggregation---which enables processing of 1 mega or more events per second on standard CPU.   In experiments using real data, we demonstrated the real-time performance and robustness of our framework.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"EventNet:,Asynchronous,Recursive,Event,Processing"
393,Recurrent Back-Projection Network for Video Super-Resolution,"We proposed a novel architecture for the problem of video super-resolution. We integrate spatial and temporal contexts from continuous video frames using a recurrent encoder-decoder module, that fuses multi-frame information with the more traditional, single frame super-resolution path for the target frame. In contrast to most prior work where frames are pooled together by stacking or warping, our model, the Recurrent Back-Projection Network (RBPN) treats each context frame as a separate source of information. These sources are combined in an iterative refinement framework inspired by the idea of back-projection in multiple-image super-resolution. This is aided by explicitly representing estimated inter-frame motion with respect to the target, rather than explicitly aligning frames. We propose a new video super-resolution benchmark, allowing evaluation at a larger scale and considering videos in different motion regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that our RBPN is superior to existing methods on several datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Recurrent,Back-Projection,Network,for,Video,Super-Resolution"
394,Cascaded Partial Decoder for Fast and Accurate Salient Object Detection,"Existing state-of-the-art salient object detection networks rely on aggregating multi-level features of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, compared to high-level features, low-level features contribute less to performance. Meanwhile, they raise more computational cost because of their larger spatial resolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascaded Partial Decoder (CPD) framework for fast and accurate salient object detection. On the one hand, the framework constructs partial decoder which discards larger resolution features of shallow layers for acceleration. On the other hand, we observe that integrating features of deep layers will obtain relatively precise saliency map. Therefore we directly utilize generated saliency map to recurrently optimize features of deep layers. This strategy efficiently suppresses distractors in the features and significantly improves their representation ability. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets exhibit that the proposed model not only achieves state-of-the-art but also runs much faster than existing models. Besides, we apply the proposed framework to optimize existing multi-level feature aggregation models and significantly improve their efficiency and accuracy.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cascaded,Partial,Decoder,for,Fast,and,Accurate,Salient,Object,Detection"
395,A Simple Pooling-Based Design for Real-Time Salient Object Detection,"We solve the problem of salient object detection by investigating how to expand the role of pooling in convolutional neural networks. Based on the U-shape architecture, we first build a global guidance module (GGM) upon the bottom-up pathway, aiming at providing layers at different feature levels the location information of potential salient objects. We further design a feature aggregation module (FAM) to make the coarse-level semantic information well fused with the fine-level features from the top-down path- way. By adding FAMs after the fusion operations in the top-down pathway, coarse-level features from the GGM can be seamlessly merged with features at various scales. These two pooling-based modules allow the high-level semantic features to be progressively refined, yielding detail enriched saliency maps. Experiment results show that our proposed approach can more accurately locate the salient objects with sharpened details and hence substantially improve the performance compared to the previous state-of-the-arts. Our approach is fast as well and can run at a speed of more than 30 FPS when processing a 300x400 image.

396,Contrast Prior and Fluid Pyramid Integration for RGBD Salient Object Detection,"The large availability of depth sensors provides valuable complementary information for salient object detection (SOD) in RGBD images. However, due to the inherent difference between RGB and depth information, extracting features from the depth channel using ImageNet pre-trained backbone models and fusing them with RGB features directly are sub-optimal. In this paper, we utilize contrast prior, which used to be a dominant cue in none deep learning based SOD approaches, into CNNs-based architecture to enhance the depth information. The enhanced depth cues are further integrated with RGB features for SOD, using a novel fluid pyramid integration, which can make better use of multi-scale cross-modal features. Comprehensive experiments on 5 challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the architecture CPFP over 9 state-of-the-art alternative methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Contrast,Prior,and,Fluid,Pyramid,Integration,for,RGBD,Salient,Object,Detection"
397,Progressive Image Deraining Networks: A Better and Simpler Baseline,"Along with the deraining performance improvement of deep networks, their structures and learning become more and more complicated and diverse, making it difficult to analyze the contribution of various network modules when developing new deraining networks. To handle this issue, this paper provides a better and simpler baseline deraining network by considering network architecture, input and output, and loss functions. Specifically, by repeatedly unfolding a shallow ResNet, progressive ResNet (PRN) is proposed to take advantage of recursive computation. A recurrent layer is further introduced to exploit the dependencies of deep features across stages, forming our progressive recurrent network (PReNet). Furthermore, intra-stage recursive computation of ResNet can be adopted in PRN and PReNet to notably reduce network parameters with unsubstantial degradation in deraining performance. For network input and output, we take both stage-wise result and original rainy image as input to each ResNet and finally output the prediction of residual image. As for loss functions, single MSE or negative SSIM losses are sufficient to train PRN and PReNet. Experiments show that PRN and PReNet perform favorably on both synthetic and real rainy images. Considering its simplicity, efficiency and effectiveness, our models are expected to serve as a suitable baseline in future deraining research.

Instead of treating object proposal as a direct bounding box regression problem, we take an analysis-by-synthesis strategy and generate proposals by reconstructing shapes from noisy observations in a scene. We incorporate GSPN into a novel 3D instance segmentation framework named Region-based PointNet (R-PointNet) which allows flexible proposal refinement and instance segmentation generation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on several 3D instance segmentation tasks. The success of GSPN largely comes from its emphasis on geometric understandings during object proposal, greatly reducing proposals with low objectness.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"GSPN:,Generative,Shape,Proposal,Network,for,3D,Instance,Segmentation,in,Point,Cloud"

Despite the recent success in object detection using deep learning techniques, inferring complex contextual relationships and structured graph representations from visual data remains a challenging topic. In this study, we propose a novel Attentive Relational Network that consists of two key modules with an object detection backbone to approach this problem. The first module is a semantic transformation module utilized to capture semantic embedded relation features, by translating visual features and linguistic features into a common semantic space. The other module is a graph self-attention module introduced to embed a joint graph representation through assigning various importance weights to neighboring nodes. Finally, accurate scene graphs are produced by the relation inference module to recognize all entities and corresponding relations. We evaluate our proposed method on the widely-adopted Visual Genome Dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Attentive,Relational,Networks,for,Mapping,Images,to,Scene,Graphs"

Previous approaches can be expressed as a form of training the student to mimic output activations of individual data examples represented by the teacher. We introduce a novel approach, dubbed relational knowledge distillation (RKD), that transfers mutual relations of data examples instead. For concrete realizations of RKD, we propose distance-wise and angle-wise distillation losses that penalize structural differences in relations. Experiments conducted on different tasks show that the proposed method improves educated student models with a significant margin. In particular for metric learning, it allows students to outperform their teachers' performance, achieving the state of the arts on standard benchmark datasets.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Relational,Knowledge,Distillation"
401,Compressing Convolutional Neural Networks via Factorized Convolutional Filters,"This work studies the model compression for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via filter pruning. The workflow of a traditional pruning consists of three sequential stages: pre-training the original model, selecting the pre-trained filters via ranking according to a manually designed criterion (e.g., the norm of filters), and learning the remained filters via fine-tuning. Most existing works follow this pipeline and focus on designing different ranking criteria for filter selection. However, it is difficult to control the performance due to the separation of filter selection and filter learning. In this work, we propose to conduct filter selection and filter learning simultaneously, in a unified model. To this end, we define a factorized convolutional filter (FCF), consisting of a standard real-valued convolutional filter and a binary scalar, as well as a dot-product operator between them. We train a CNN model with factorized convolutional filters (CNN-FCF) by updating the standard filter using back-propagation, while updating the binary scalar using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based optimization method. With this trained CNN-FCF model, we only keep the standard filters corresponding to the 1-valued scalars, while all other filters and all binary scalars are discarded, to obtain a compact CNN model. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Compressing,Convolutional,Neural,Networks,via,Factorized,Convolutional,Filters"
402,On the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Image Representations,"This paper addresses the following questions pertaining to the intrinsic dimensionality of any given image representation: (i) estimate its intrinsic dimensionality, (ii) develop a deep neural network based non-linear mapping, dubbed DeepMDS, that transforms the ambient representation to the minimal intrinsic space, and (iii) validate the veracity of the mapping through image matching in the intrinsic space. Experiments on benchmark image datasets (LFW, IJB-C and ImageNet-100) reveal that the intrinsic dimensionality of deep neural network representations is significantly lower than the dimensionality of the ambient features. For instance, SphereFace's 512-dim face representation and ResNet's 512-dim image representation have an intrinsic dimensionality of 16 and 19 respectively. Further, the DeepMDS mapping is able to obtain a representation of significantly lower dimensionality while maintaining discriminative ability to a large extent, 59.75% TAR @ 0.1% FAR in 16-dim vs 71.26% TAR in 512-dim on IJB-C and a Top-1 accuracy of 77.0% at 19-dim vs 83.4% at 512-dim on ImageNet-100.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"On,the,Intrinsic,Dimensionality,of,Image,Representations"

With the development of deep learning approaches, vehicle Re-ID still faces a near-duplicate challenge, which is to distinguish different instances with nearly identical appearances. Previous methods simply rely on the global visual features to handle this problem. In this paper, we proposed a simple but efficient part-regularized discriminative feature preserving method which enhances the perceptive ability of subtle discrepancies. We further develop a novel framework to integrate part constrains with the global Re-ID modules by introducing an detection branch. Our framework is trained end-to-end with combined local and global constrains. Specially, without the part-regularized local constrains in inference step, our Re-ID network outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin on large benchmark datasets VehicleID and VeRi-776.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Part-Regularized,Near-Duplicate,Vehicle,Re-Identification"
404,Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Videos by Predicting Motion and Appearance Statistics,"We address the problem of video representation learning without human-annotated labels. While previous efforts address the problem by designing novel self-supervised tasks using video data, the learned features are merely on a frame-by-frame basis, which are not applicable to many video analytic tasks where spatio-temporal features are prevailing. In this paper we propose a novel self-supervised approach to learn spatio-temporal features for video representation. Inspired by the success of two-stream approaches in video classification, we propose to learn visual features by regressing both motion and appearance statistics along spatial and temporal dimensions, given only the input video data. Specifically, we extract statistical concepts (fast-motion region and the corresponding dominant direction, spatio-temporal color diversity, dominant color, etc.) from simple patterns in both spatial and temporal domains. Unlike prior puzzles that are even hard for humans to solve, the proposed approach is consistent with human inherent visual habits and therefore easy to answer. We conduct extensive experiments with C3D to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experiments show that our approach can significantly improve the performance of C3D when applied to video classification tasks.

Existing open-set classifiers rely on deep networks trained in a supervised manner on known classes in the training set; this causes specialization of learned representations to known classes and makes it hard to distinguish unknowns from knowns. In contrast, we train networks for joint classification and reconstruction of input data. This enhances the learned representation so as to preserve information useful for separating unknowns from knowns, as well as to discriminate classes of knowns. Our novel Classification-Reconstruction learning for Open-Set Recognition (CROSR) utilizes latent representations for reconstruction and enables robust unknown detection without harming the known-class classification accuracy. Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed method outperforms existing deep open-set classifiers in multiple standard datasets and is robust to diverse outliers.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Classification-Reconstruction,Learning,for,Open-Set,Recognition"
406,Emotion-Aware Human Attention Prediction,"Despite the recent success in face recognition and object classification, in the field of human gaze prediction, computer models are still struggling to accurately mimic human attention. One main reason is that visual attention is a complex human behavior influenced by multiple factors, ranging from low-level features (e.g., color, contrast) to high-level human perception (e.g., objects interactions, object sentiment), making it difficult to model computationally. In this work, we investigate the relation between object sentiment and human attention. We first introduce a new evaluation metric (AttI) for measuring human attention that focuses on human fixation consensus. A series of empirical data analyses with AttI indicate that emotion-evoking objects receive attention favor, especially when they co-occur with emotionally-neutral objects, and this favor varies with different image complexity. Based on the empirical analyses, we design a deep neural network for human attention prediction which allows the attention bias on emotion-evoking objects to be encoded in its feature space. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance, especially on metrics that evaluate relative importance of salient regions. This research provides the clearest picture to date on how object sentiments influence human attention, and it makes one of the first attempts to model this phenomenon computationally.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Emotion-Aware,Human,Attention,Prediction"

Although recent deep learning based counting algorithms have achieved a great progress, the correlation knowledge among samples and the semantic prior have not yet been fully exploited. In this paper, a residual regression framework is proposed for crowd counting utilizing the correlation information among samples. By incorporating such information into our network, we discover that more intrinsic characteristics can be learned by the network which thus generalizes better to unseen scenarios. Besides, we show how to effectively leverage the semantic prior to improve the performance of crowd counting. We also observe that the adversarial loss can be used to improve the quality of predicted density maps, thus leading to an improvement in crowd counting. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Residual,Regression,With,Semantic,Prior,for,Crowd,Counting"
408,Context-Reinforced Semantic Segmentation,"Recent efforts have shown the importance of context on deep convolutional neural network based semantic segmentation. Among others, the predicted segmentation map (p-map) itself which encodes rich high-level semantic cues (e.g. objects and layout) can be regarded as a promising source of context. In this paper, we propose a dedicated module, Context Net, to better explore the context information in p-maps. Without introducing any new supervisions, we formulate the context learning problem as a Markov Decision Process and optimize it using reinforcement learning during which the p-map and Context Net are treated as environment and agent, respectively. Through adequate explorations, the Context Net selects the information which has long-term benefit for segmentation inference. By incorporating the Context Net with a baseline segmentation scheme, we then propose a Context-reinforced Semantic Segmentation network (CiSS-Net), which is fully end-to-end trainable. Experimental results show that the learned context brings 3.9% absolute improvement on mIoU over the baseline segmentation method, and the CiSS-Net achieves the state-of-the-art segmentation performance on ADE20K, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Context-Reinforced,Semantic,Segmentation"
409,Adversarial Structure Matching for Structured Prediction Tasks,"Pixel-wise losses, i.e., cross-entropy or L2, have been widely used in structured prediction tasks as a spatial extension of generic image classification or regression. However, its i.i.d. assumption neglects the structural regularity present in natural images. Various attempts have been made to incorporate structural reasoning mostly through structure priors in a cooperative way where co-occurring patterns are encouraged. We, on the other hand, approach this problem from an opposing angle and propose a new framework, Adversarial Structure Matching (ASM), for training such structured prediction networks via an adversarial process, in which we train a structure analyzer that provides the supervisory signals, the ASM loss. The structure analyzer is trained to maximize ASM loss, or to emphasize recurring multi-scale hard negative structural mistakes usually among co-occurring patterns. On the contrary, the structured prediction network is trained to reduce those mistakes and is thus enabled to distinguish fine-grained structures. As a result, training structured prediction networks using ASM reduces contextual confusion among objects and improves boundary localization. We demonstrate that ASM outperforms its pixel-wise counterpart and commonly used structure priors, GAN, on three different structured prediction tasks, namely, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and surface normal prediction.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Adversarial,Structure,Matching,for,Structured,Prediction,Tasks"

Deep clustering combines embedding and clustering together to obtain optimal embedding subspace for clustering, which can be more effective compared with conventional clustering methods. In this paper, we propose a joint learning framework for discriminative embedding and spectral clustering. We first devise a dual autoencoder network, which enforces the reconstruction constraint for the latent representations and their noisy versions, to embed the inputs into a latent space for clustering. As such the learned latent representations can be more robust to noise. Then the mutual information estimation is utilized to provide more discriminative information from the inputs. Furthermore, a deep spectral clustering method is applied to embed the latent representations into the eigenspace and subsequently clusters them, which can fully exploit the relationship between inputs to achieve optimal clustering results. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art clustering approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Spectral,Clustering,Using,Dual,Autoencoder,Network"
411,Deep Asymmetric Metric Learning via Rich Relationship Mining,"Learning effective distance metric between data has gained increasing popularity, for its promising performance on various tasks, such as face verification, zero-shot learning, and image retrieval. A major line of researches employs hard data mining, which makes efforts on searching a subset of significant data. However, hard data mining based approaches only rely on a small percentage of data, which is apt to overfitting. This motivates us to propose a novel framework, named deep asymmetric metric learning via rich relationship mining (DAMLRRM), to mine rich relationship under satisfying sampling size. DAMLRRM constructs two asymmetric data streams that are differently structured and of unequal length. The asymmetric structure enables the two data streams to interlace each other, which allows for the informative comparison between new data pairs over iterations. To improve the generalization ability, we further relax the constraint on the intra-class relationship. Rather than greedily connecting all possible positive pairs, DAMLRRM builds a minimum-cost spanning tree within each category to ensure the formation of a connected region. As such there exists at least one direct or indirect path between arbitrary positive pairs to bridge intra-class relevance. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets including CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products show that DAMLRRM effectively boosts the performance of existing deep metric learning approaches.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Asymmetric,Metric,Learning,via,Rich,Relationship,Mining"

Learning to Detect Point-Of-Interest Changes for Proactive Map Updates,"Maps are an increasingly important tool in our daily lives, yet their rich semantic content still largely depends on manual input. Motivated by the broad availability of geo-tagged street-view images, we propose a new task aiming to make the map update process more proactive. We focus on automatically detecting changes of Points of Interest (POIs), specifically stores or shops of any kind, based on visual input. Faced with the lack of an appropriate benchmark, we build and release a large dataset, captured in two large shopping centers, that comprises 33K geo-localized images and 578 POIs. We then design a generic approach that compares two image sets captured in the same venue at different times and outputs POI changes as a ranked list of map locations. In contrast to logo or franchise recognition approaches, our system does not depend on an external franchise database. It is instead inspired by recent deep metric learning approaches that learn a similarity function fit to the task at hand. We compare various loss functions to learn a metric aligned with the POI change detection goal, and report promising results.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Did,It,Change?,Learning,to,Detect,Point-Of-Interest,Changes,for,Proactive,Map,Updates"

Specifically, we make instance segmentation benefit from semantic segmentation through learning semantic-aware point-level instance embedding. Meanwhile, semantic features of the points belonging to the same instance are fused together to make more accurate per-point semantic predictions.

414,"Pattern-Affinitive Propagation Across Depth, Surface Normal and Semantic Segmentation","In this paper, we propose a novel Pattern-Affinitive Propagation (PAP) framework to jointly predict depth, surface normal and semantic segmentation. The motivation behind it comes from the statistic observation that pattern-affinitive pairs recur much frequently across different tasks as well as within a task. Thus, we can conduct two types of propagations, cross-task propagation and task-specific propagation, to adaptively diffuse those similar patterns. The former integrates cross-task affinity patterns to adapt to each task therein through the calculation on non-local relationships. Next the latter performs an iterative diffusion in the feature space so that the cross-task affinity patterns can be widely-spread within the task. Accordingly, the learning of each task can be regularized and boosted by the complementary task-level affinities.

415,Scene Categorization From Contours: Medial Axis Based Salience Measures,"The computer vision community has witnessed recent advances in scene categorization from images, with the state of the art systems now achieving impressive recognition rates on challenging benchmarks. Such systems have been trained on photographs which include color, texture and shading cues. The geometry of shapes and surfaces, as conveyed by scene contours, is not explicitly considered for this task. Remarkably, humans can accurately recognize natural scenes from line drawings, which consist solely of contour-based shape cues. Here we report the first computer vision study on scene categorization of line drawings derived from popular databases including an artist scene database, MIT67 and Places365. Specifically, we use off-the-shelf pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform scene classification given only contour information as input, and find performance levels well above chance. We also show that medial-axis based contour salience methods can be used to select more informative subsets of contour pixels, and that the variation in CNN classification performance on various choices for these subsets is qualitatively similar to that observed in human performance. Moreover, when the salience measures are used to weight the contours, we find that these weights boost our CNN performance above that for unweighted contour input. That is, the medial axis based salience weights appear to add useful information that is not available when CNNs are trained to use contours alone.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Scene,Categorization,From,Contours:,Medial,Axis,Based,Salience,Measures"
416,Unsupervised Image Captioning,"Deep neural networks have achieved great successes on the image captioning task. However, most of the existing models depend heavily on paired image-sentence datasets, which are very expensive to acquire. In this paper, we make the first attempt to train an image captioning model in an unsupervised manner. Instead of relying on manually labeled image-sentence pairs, our proposed model merely requires an image set, a sentence corpus, and an existing visual concept detector. The sentence corpus is used to teach the captioning model how to generate plausible sentences. Meanwhile, the knowledge in the visual concept detector is distilled into the captioning model to guide the model to recognize the visual concepts in an image. In order to further encourage the generated captions to be semantically consistent with the image, the image and caption are projected into a common latent space so that they can reconstruct each other. Given that the existing sentence corpora are mainly designed for linguistic research and are thus with little reference to image contents, we crawl a large-scale image description corpus of two million natural sentences to facilitate the unsupervised image captioning scenario. Experimental results show that our proposed model is able to produce quite promising results without any caption annotations.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Unsupervised,Image,Captioning"
417,Exact Adversarial Attack to Image Captioning via Structured Output Learning With Latent Variables,"In this work, we study the robustness of a CNN+RNN based image captioning system being subjected to adversarial noises. We propose to fool an image captioning system to generate some targeted partial captions for an image polluted by adversarial noises, even the targeted captions are totally irrelevant to the image content. A partial caption indicates that the words at some locations in this caption are observed, while words at other locations are not restricted. It is the first work to study exact adversarial attacks of targeted partial captions. Due to the sequential dependencies among words in a caption, we formulate the generation of adversarial noises for targeted partial captions as a structured output learning problem with latent variables. Both the generalized expectation maximization algorithm and structural SVMs with latent variables are then adopted to optimize the problem. The proposed methods generate very successful attacks to three popular CNN+RNN based image captioning models. Furthermore, the proposed attack methods are used to understand the inner mechanism of image captioning systems, providing the guidance to further improve automatic image captioning systems towards human captioning.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Exact,Adversarial,Attack,to,Image,Captioning,via,Structured,Output,Learning,With,Latent,Variables"
418,Cross-Modal Relationship Inference for Grounding Referring Expressions,"Grounding referring expressions is a fundamental yet challenging task facilitating human-machine communication in the physical world. It locates the target object in an image on the basis of the comprehension of the relationships between referring natural language expressions and the image. A feasible solution for grounding referring expressions not only needs to extract all the necessary information (i.e. objects and the relationships among them) in both the image and referring expressions, but also compute and represent multimodal contexts from the extracted information. Unfortunately, existing work on grounding referring expressions cannot extract multi-order relationships from the referring expressions accurately and the contexts they obtain have discrepancies with the contexts described by referring expressions. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Relationship Extractor (CMRE) to adaptively highlight objects and relationships, that have connections with a given expression, with a cross-modal attention mechanism, and represent the extracted information as a language-guided visual relation graph. In addition, we propose a Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) to compute multimodal semantic contexts by fusing information from different modes and propagating multimodal information in the structured relation graph. Experiments on various common benchmark datasets show that our Cross-Modal Relationship Inference Network, which consists of CMRE and GGCN, outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Cross-Modal,Relationship,Inference,for,Grounding,Referring,Expressions"
419,What's to Know? Uncertainty as a Guide to Asking Goal-Oriented Questions,"One of the core challenges in Visual Dialogue problems is asking the question that will provide the most useful information towards achieving the required objective.  Encouraging an agent to ask the right questions is difficult because we don't know a-priori what information the agent will need to achieve its task, and we don't have an explicit model of what it knows already. We propose a solution to this problem based on a Bayesian model of the uncertainty in the implicit model maintained by the visual dialogue agent, and in the function used to select an appropriate output.  By selecting the question that minimises the predicted regret with respect to this implicit model the agent actively reduces ambiguity. The Bayesian model of uncertainty also enables a principled method for identifying when enough information has been acquired, and an action should be selected. We evaluate our approach on two goal-oriented dialogue datasets, one for visual-based collaboration task and the other for a negotiation-based task. Our uncertainty-aware information-seeking model outperforms its counterparts in these two challenging problems.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"What's,to,Know?,Uncertainty,as,a,Guide,to,Asking,Goal-Oriented,Questions"
420,Iterative Alignment Network for Continuous Sign Language Recognition,"In this paper, we propose an alignment network with iterative optimization for weakly supervised continuous sign language recognition. Our framework consists of two modules: a 3D convolutional residual network (3D-ResNet) for feature learning and an encoder-decoder network with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) for sequence modelling. The above two modules are optimized in an alternate way. In the encoder-decoder sequence learning network, two decoders are included, i.e., LSTM decoder and CTC decoder. Both decoders are jointly trained by maximum likelihood criterion with a soft Dynamic Time Warping (soft-DTW) alignment constraint. The warping path, which indicates the possible alignment between input video clips and sign words, is used to fine-tune the 3D-ResNet as training labels with classification loss. After fine-tuning, the improved features are extracted for optimization of encoder-decoder sequence learning network in next iteration. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two large scale continuous sign language recognition benchmarks, i.e., RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather and CSL. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Iterative,Alignment,Network,for,Continuous,Sign,Language,Recognition"
421,Neural Sequential Phrase Grounding (SeqGROUND),"We propose an  end-to-end approach for phrase grounding in images. Unlike prior methods that typically attempt to ground each phrase independently by building an image-text embedding, our architecture formulates grounding of multiple phrases as a sequential and contextual process. Specifically,  we encode region proposals and all phrases into two stacks of LSTM cells, along with so-far grounded phrase-region pairs. These LSTM stacks collectively capture context for grounding of the next phrase. The resulting architecture, which we call SeqGROUND, supports many-to-many matching by allowing an image region to be matched to multiple phrases and vice versa. We show competitive performance on the Flickr30K benchmark dataset and, through ablation studies, validate the efficacy of sequential grounding as well as individual design choices in our model architecture.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Neural,Sequential,Phrase,Grounding,(SeqGROUND)"
422,CLEVR-Ref+: Diagnosing Visual Reasoning With Referring Expressions,"Referring object detection and referring image segmentation are important tasks that require joint understanding of visual information and natural language. Yet there has been evidence that current benchmark datasets suffer from bias, and current state-of-the-art models cannot be easily evaluated on their intermediate reasoning process. To address these issues and complement similar efforts in visual question answering, we build CLEVR-Ref+, a synthetic diagnostic dataset for referring expression comprehension. The precise locations and attributes of the objects are readily available, and the referring expressions are automatically associated with functional programs. The synthetic nature allows control over dataset bias (through sampling strategy), and the modular programs enable intermediate reasoning ground truth without human annotators.  In addition to evaluating several state-of-the-art models on CLEVR-Ref+, we also propose IEP-Ref, a module network approach that significantly outperforms other models on our dataset. In particular, we present two interesting and important findings using IEP-Ref: (1) the module trained to transform feature maps into segmentation masks can be attached to any intermediate module to reveal the entire reasoning process step-by-step; (2) even if all training data has at least one object referred, IEP-Ref can correctly predict no-foreground when presented with false-premise referring expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct and quantitative proof that neural modules behave in the way they are intended. We will release data and code for CLEVR-Ref+.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CLEVR-Ref+:,Diagnosing,Visual,Reasoning,With,Referring,Expressions"
423,Describing Like Humans: On Diversity in Image Captioning,"Recently, the state-of-the-art models for image captioning have overtaken human performance based on the most popular metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE and CIDEr. Does this mean we have solved the task of image captioning The above metrics only measure the similarity of the generated caption to the human annotations, which reflects its accuracy. However, an image contains many concepts and multiple levels of detail, and thus there is a variety of captions that express different concepts and details that might be interesting for different humans. Therefore only evaluating accuracy is not sufficient for measuring the performance of captioning models --- the diversity of the generated captions should also be considered. In this paper, we proposed a new metric for measuring the diversity of image captions, which is derived from latent semantic analysis and kernelized to use CIDEr similarity. We conduct extensive experiments to re-evaluate recent captioning models in the context of both diversity and accuracy. We find that there is still a large gap between the model and human performance in terms of both accuracy and diversity, and the models that have optimized accuracy (CIDEr) have low diversity. We also show that balancing the cross-entropy loss and CIDEr reward in reinforcement learning during training can effectively control the tradeoff between diversity and accuracy of the generated captions.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Describing,Like,Humans:,On,Diversity,in,Image,Captioning"
424,MSCap: Multi-Style Image Captioning With Unpaired Stylized Text,"In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning network for the task of multi-style image captioning (MSCap) with a standard factual image caption dataset and a multi-stylized language corpus without paired images. How to learn a single model for multi-stylized image captioning with unpaired data is a challenging and necessary task, whereas rarely studied in previous works. The proposed framework mainly includes four contributive modules following a typical image encoder. First, a style dependent caption generator to output a sentence conditioned on an encoded image and a specified style. Second, a caption discriminator is presented to distinguish the input sentence to be real or not. The discriminator and the generator are trained in an adversarial manner to enable more natural and human-like captions. Third, a style classifier is employed to discriminate the specific style of the input sentence. Besides, a back-translation module is designed to enforce the generated stylized captions are visually grounded, with the intuition of the cycle consistency for factual caption and stylized caption. We enable an end-to-end optimization of the whole model with differentiable softmax approximation. At last, we conduct comprehensive experiments using a combined dataset containing four caption styles to demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed method.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"MSCap:,Multi-Style,Image,Captioning,With,Unpaired,Stylized,Text"
425,CRAVES: Controlling Robotic Arm With a Vision-Based Economic System,"Training a robotic arm to accomplish real-world tasks has been attracting increasing attention in both academia and industry. This work discusses the role of computer vision algorithms in this field. We focus on low-cost arms on which no sensors are equipped and thus all decisions are made upon visual recognition, e.g., real-time 3D pose estimation. This requires annotating a lot of training data, which is not only time-consuming but also laborious. In this paper, we present an alternative solution, which uses a 3D model to create a large number of synthetic data, trains a vision model in this virtual domain, and applies it to real-world images after domain adaptation. To this end, we design a semi-supervised approach, which fully leverages the geometric constraints among keypoints. We apply an iterative algorithm for optimization. Without any annotations on real images, our algorithm generalizes well and produces satisfying results on 3D pose estimation, which is evaluated on two real-world datasets. We also construct a vision-based control system for task accomplishment, for which we train a reinforcement learning agent in a virtual environment and apply it to the real-world. Moreover, our approach, with merely a 3D model being required, has the potential to generalize to other types of multi-rigid-body dynamic systems.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"CRAVES:,Controlling,Robotic,Arm,With,a,Vision-Based,Economic,System"
426,Networks for Joint Affine and Non-Parametric Image Registration,"We introduce an end-to-end deep-learning framework for 3D medical image registration. In contrast to existing approaches, our framework combines two registration methods: an affine registration and a vector momentum-parameterized stationary velocity field (vSVF) model. Specifically, it consists of three stages. In the first stage, a multi-step affine network predicts affine transform parameters. In the second stage, we use a U-Net-like network to generate a momentum, from which a velocity field can be computed via smoothing. Finally, in the third stage, we employ a self-iterable map-based vSVF component to provide a non-parametric refinement based on the current estimate of the transformation map. Once the model is trained, a registration is completed in one forward pass. To evaluate the performance, we conducted longitudinal and cross-subject experiments on 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the knee of the  Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. Results show that our framework achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art medical image registration approaches, but it is much faster, with a better control of transformation regularity including the ability to produce approximately symmetric transformations, and combining affine as well as non-parametric registration.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Networks,for,Joint,Affine,and,Non-Parametric,Image,Registration"
427,Learning Shape-Aware Embedding for Scene Text Detection,"We address the problem of detecting scene text in arbitrary shapes, which is a challenging task due to the high variety and complexity of the scene. Specifically, we treat text detection as instance segmentation and propose a segmentation-based framework, which extracts each text instance as an independent connected component. To distinguish different text instances, our method maps pixels onto an embedding space where pixels belonging to the same text are encouraged to appear closer to each other and vise versa. In addition, we introduce a Shape-Aware Loss to make training adaptively accommodate various aspect ratios of text instances and the tiny gaps among them, and a new post-processing pipeline to yield precise bounding box predictions. Experimental results on three challenging datasets (ICDAR15, MSRA-TD500 and CTW1500) demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,Shape-Aware,Embedding,for,Scene,Text,Detection"
428,Learning to Film From Professional Human Motion Videos,"We investigate the problem of 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) camera planning for filming professional human motion videos using a camera drone. Existing methods  either plan motions for only a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera, or adopt ad-hoc solutions without carefully considering the impact of video contents and previous camera motions on the future camera motions. As a result, they can hardly achieve satisfactory results in our drone cinematography task. In this study, we propose a learning-based framework which  incorporates the video contents and previous camera motions to predict the future camera motions that enable the capture of professional videos. Specifically, the inputs of our framework are video contents which are represented using subject-related feature based on 2D skeleton and scene-related features extracted from background RGB images, and camera motions which are represented using optical flows. The correlation between the inputs and output future camera motions are learned via a sequence-to-sequence convolutional long short-term memory (Seq2Seq ConvLSTM) network from a large set of video clips. We deploy our approach to a real drone cinematography system by first predicting the future camera motions, and then converting them to the drone's control commands via an odometer. Our experimental results on extensive datasets and showcases exhibit significant improvements in our approach over conventional baselines and our approach can successfully mimic the footage of a professional cameraman.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Learning,to,Film,From,Professional,Human,Motion,Videos"
429,Pay Attention! - Robustifying a Deep Visuomotor Policy Through Task-Focused Visual Attention,"Several recent studies have demonstrated the promise of deep visuomotor policies for robot manipulator control. Despite impressive progress, these systems are known to be vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as accidental or adversarial bumps that make them drop the manipulated object. They also tend to be distracted by visual disturbances such as objects moving in the robot's field of view, even if the disturbance does not physically prevent the execution of the task. In this paper, we propose an approach for augmenting a deep visuomotor policy trained through demonstrations with Task Focused visual Attention (TFA). The manipulation task is specified with a natural language text such as ""move the red bowl to the left"". This allows the visual attention component to concentrate on the current object that the robot needs to manipulate. We show that even in benign environments, the TFA allows the policy to consistently outperform a variant with no attention mechanism. More importantly, the new policy is significantly more robust: it regularly recovers from severe physical disturbances (such as bumps causing it to drop the object) from which the baseline policy, i.e. with no visual attention, almost never recovers. In addition, we show that the proposed policy performs correctly in the presence of a wide class of visual disturbances, exhibiting a behavior reminiscent of human selective visual attention experiments.",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Pay,Attention!,-,Robustifying,a,Deep,Visuomotor,Policy,Through,Task-Focused,Visual,Attention"
430,Deep Blind Video Decaptioning by Temporal Aggregation and Recurrence,"Blind video decaptioning is a problem of automatically removing text overlays and inpainting the occluded parts in videos without any input masks. While recent deep learning based inpainting methods deal with a single image and mostly assume that the positions of the corrupted pixels are known, we aim at automatic text removal in video sequences without mask information. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for fast blind video decaptioning. We construct an encoder-decoder model, where the encoder takes multiple source frames that can provide visible pixels revealed from the scene dynamics. These hints are aggregated and fed into the decoder. We apply a residual connection from the input frame to the decoder output to enforce our network to focus on the corrupted regions only. Our proposed model was ranked in the first place in the ECCV Chalearn 2018 LAP Inpainting Competition Track2: Video decaptioning. In addition, we further improve this strong model by applying a recurrent feedback. The recurrent feedback not only enforces temporal coherence but also provides strong clues on where the corrupted pixels are. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our full model produces accurate and temporally consistent video results in real time (50+ fps).",http://openaccess.thecvf.com//www.cv-foundation.org/,"Deep,Blind,Video,Decaptioning,by,Temporal,Aggregation,and,Recurrence"
